We also observe the well-known fact that in a right triangle, the median to the hypotenuse is of half the length of the hypotenuse.  (This is true because if we inscribe the triangle in a circle, the hypotenuse is the diameter, so a segment from any point on the circle to the midpoint of the hypotenuse is a radius.)\n### Solution 1\nThe conditions of the problem require that\n\n$ab = \\frac{c^2}{4}.$\n\nHowever, we notice that twice the area of the triangle $abc$ is $ab$, since $a$ and $b$ form a right angle.  However, twice the area of the triangle is also the product of $c$ and the altitude to $c$.  Hence the altitude to $c$ must have length $\\frac{c}{4}$.  Therefore if we construct a circle with diameter $c$ and a line parallel to $c$ and of distance $\\frac{c}{4}$ from $c$, either point of intersection between the line and the circle will provide a suitable third vertex for the triangle.  Q.E.D.\n### Solution 2\nWe denote the angle between $b$ and $c$ as $\\alpha$.  The problem requires that\n\n$ab = \\frac{c^2}{4},$\n\nor, equivalently, that\n\n$2 \\frac{ab}{c^2} = \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nHowever, since $\\frac{a}{c} = \\sin{\\alpha};\\; \\frac{b}{c} = \\cos{\\alpha}$, we can rewrite the condition as\n\n$2\\sin{\\alpha}\\cos{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2},$\n\nor, equivalently, as\n\n$\\sin{2\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2}.$\n\nFrom this it becomes apparent that $2\\alpha = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ or $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$; hence the other two angles in the triangle must be $\\frac{ \\pi }{12}$ and $\\frac{ 5 \\pi }{12}$, which are not difficult to construct.  Q.E.D.\nNote.  It is not difficult to reconcile these two constructions.  Indeed, we notice that the altitude of the triangle is of length $c \\sin{\\alpha}\\cos{\\alpha}$, which both of the solutions set equal to $\\frac{c}{4}$ .\n### Solution 3\nIf we let the legs be $a$ and $b$ with $a < b$, then $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Because $c^2 = 4 a b$ as well, we immediately deduce via some short computations through quadratic formula that $a = (2 - \\sqrt{3})b$ and $a = (2 + \\sqrt{3})b$. Thus, $\\frac{a}{b} = \\tan 15^\\circ$ and $\\frac{a}{b} = \\tan 75^\\circ$, and so one of the angles of the triangle must be $15^\\circ$ and the other must be $75^\\circ$. A $15^\\circ$ angle is easily constructed by bisecting a $30^\\circ$ angle (which is formed by constructing the altitude of an equilateral triangle), and $75^\\circ$ angle is constructed by constructing a 15 degree angle on top of the 60 degree point.\n### Solution 4\nWe draw perpendicular $h$ on $c$ and denote the angle between the median and $c$ as $\\alpha$. The area of the triangle is $\\frac{ab}{2}$ or $\\frac{ch}{2}$\nWe can write $c$ as $2\\sqrt{ab}$ So we have,\n\\[\\frac{ab}{2} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{ab}h}{2}\\]\nWhich simplifies to be\n\\[\\frac{\\sqrt{ab}}{h} = \\frac{1}{2}\\]\nOr\n\\[\\sin\\alpha = \\sin\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\]\nSo, we draw $c$ and from it's midpoint, we draw a segment $\\frac{c}{2}$ forming an angle $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$\nJoin the vertices to get the required triangle.\n### Solution 5\nThis is a geometric solution. We start with some observations in the first paragraph and describe the construction in the next paragraph. Consider any right triangle with hypotenuse c. Construct square with side length c on the opposite side of c from the triangle. Construct 3 more triangles congruent to the original triangle on the outside of each of the three other sides of the square in such a way that a larger square with side length a+b is formed. The area of this larger square is c^2+2ab = 1.5c^2 so a+b = (3/2)^(1/2) *c \nNow go back to the given c. Construct a square with side length c first. Let two adjacent corners of it be M and N. Construct the square's diagonals and let center of the square be O. Construct a circle around O with radius (3/2)^(1/2) * OM. To do so, take OM, first draw a 2:1 right triangle with OM being the short side to obtain a hypothenuse with length 3^(1/2) OM, then draw a 1:1 right triangle from that side to obtain a hypothenuse with length 6^(1/2)*OM. then bisect it for desired length. Next draw the circular locus of points X such that MXO is 45 degrees. To accomplish this, simply find the point on the perpendicular bisector of OM that is 1/(2OM) from OM. There are two such points, pick the one closer to N. Draw circle around this new point going through O and M. The intersection of the two circles is the desired third vertex of the triangle with the given hypotenuse c.\n"

Substituting this into the first equation and simplification, we get \\[100a+10b+c = 11a^2 +11b^2 +11c^2\\] For an integer divisible by $11$, the the sum of digits in the odd positions minus the sum of digits in the even positions is divisible by $11$. Thus we get: $b = a + c$ or $b = a + c - 11$.\nCase $1$: Let $b=a+c$. We get \\[100a+c+10a+10c = 11a^2 +11c^2+11(a+c)^2\\] \\[10a+c = 2a^2+2ac+2c^2\\] Since the right side is even, the left side must also be even. Let $c=2q$ for some $q = 0,1,2,3,4$. Then \\[10a+2q=2a^2+4aq+8q^2\\]\\[5a+q=a^2+2aq+4q^2\\] \nSubstitute $q=0,1,2,3,4$ into the last equation and then solve for $a$. \nWhen $q=0$, we get $a=5$. Thus $c=0$ and $b=5$. We get that $N=550$ which works.\nWhen $q=1$, we get that $a$ is not an integer. There is no $N$ for this case. \nWhen $q=2$, we get that $a$ is not an integer. There is no $N$ for this case.\nWhen $q=3$, we get that $a$ is not an integer. There is no $N$ for this case.\nWhen $q=4$, we get that $a$ is not an integer. There is no $N$ for this case.\n\nCase $2$: Let $b = a + c - 11$. We get \\[100a+c+10a+10c -110= 11(a^2+(a+c)^2-22(a+c)+c^2+121)\\] \\[10a+c=2a^2+2c^2+2ac-22a-22c+131\\] \\[2(a-8)^2+2(c-\\frac{23}{4})^2+2ac-\\frac{505}{8}=0\\]\nNow we test all $c=0\\rightarrow10$. When $c=0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9$, we get no integer solution to $a$. Thus, for these values of $c$, there is no valid $N$. However, when $c=3$, we get  \\[2(a-8)^2+2(3-\\frac{23}{4})^2+6a-\\frac{505}{8}=0\\] \\[2(a-8)^2+6a-48 = 0\\] We get that $a=8$ is a valid solution. For this case, we get $a=8,b=0,c=3$, so $N=803$, and this is a valid value. Thus, the answers are $\\boxed{N=550,803}$.\n### Solution 2\nDefine a **ten** to be all ten positive integers which begin with a fixed tens digit.\nWe can make a systematic approach to this:\n\nBy inspection, $\\dfrac{N}{11}$ must be between 10 and 90 inclusive. That gives us 8 tens to check, and 90 as well.\nFor a given ten, the sum of the squares of the digits of $N$ increases faster than $\\dfrac{N}{11}$, so we can have at most one number in every ten that works.\nWe check the first ten:\n$11*11=121$\n$1^2+2^2+1^2=4$\n$12*11=132$\n$1^2+3^2+2^2=14$\n11 is too small and 12 is too large, so all numbers below 11 will be too small and all numbers above 12 will be too large, so no numbers in the first ten work.\nWe try the second ten:\n$21*11=231$\n$2^2+3^2+1^2=14$\n$22*11=242$\n$2^2+4^2+2^2=24$\nTherefore, no numbers in the second ten work.\nWe continue, to find out that 50 and 73 are the only ones that works.\n$N=50*11=550$, $N=73*11=803$ so there are two $N$ that works.\n### Solution 3\nNote that there are only 900 three-digit numbers. Of these, only 81 are divisible by 11. This brings to mind the great strategy of listing and bashing. Being organized while listing will get you the answer. There is plenty of time on the IMO, and listing is highly unlikely to miss cases. We end up getting $\\boxed{N=550,803}$.\n### Solution 4\n[https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h54826p22231968](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h54826p22231968)\n\n~franzliszt\n### Video Solution\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB2KTsnnmSQ&list=PLa8j0YHOYQQJGzkvK2Sm00zrh0aIQnof8&index=2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB2KTsnnmSQ&list=PLa8j0YHOYQQJGzkvK2Sm00zrh0aIQnof8&index=2)\n- AMBRIGGS\n[https://youtu.be/DRii5VjLk70](https://youtu.be/DRii5VjLk70) [Video Solution]\n"

Let $l$ denote the slant height of the cone, and let $h$ denote the height of the cone.\nConsider a plane that contains the axis of the cone. This plane will slice the cone and sphere into a circle $\\omega$ inscribed in an isosceles triangle $T$.\nThe area of $T$ may be computed in two different ways:\n\\[[T] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times r \\times (2l + 2R) = r(l+R)\\]\n\\[[T] = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2R \\times h = Rh\\]\nFrom this, we deduce that $r = \\frac{Rh}{l+R}$.\nNow, we calculate our volumes:\n\\[V_1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\pi R^2 h\\]\n\\[V_2 = \\pi r^2 \\times 2r = 2\\pi r^3 = \\frac{2R^3 h^3}{(l+R)^3}\\]\nNow, we will compute the quantity $\\frac{3(l+R)^3}{\\pi R^5 h} (V_1 - V_2)$ and prove that it is always greater than $0$.\nLet $x = \\frac{h}{R}$.

We have thus proved that $V_1 \\ne V_2$, as desired.\nPart (b):\nFrom our earlier work in calculating the volumes $V_1$ and $V_2$, we easily see that:\n\\[\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{(u+1)^3}{6(u^2 - 1)}\\]\nRe-expressing and simplifying, we have:\n\\[\\frac{6V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{(u+1)^2}{u-1} = (u-1) + 4 + \\frac{4}{u-1}\\]\nBy the AM-GM Inequality, $(u-1) + \\frac{4}{u-1} \\ge 4$, meaning that $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} \\ge \\frac{4}{3}$.\nEquality holds if and only if $u-1 = \\frac{4}{u-1}$, meaning that $u=3$ and $x = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\nIf we check the case $x = \\frac{h}{R} = 2\\sqrt{2}$, we may calculate $V_1$ and $V_2$:\n\\[V_1 = \\frac{1}{3} \\pi R^2 h = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\pi R^3\\]\n\\[V_2 = 2\\pi r^3 = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{R\\times 2\\sqrt{2} R}{4R}\\right)^3 = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}} R^3\\]\nIndeed, we have $\\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \\frac{4}{3}$, meaning that our minimum of $k = \\frac{4}{3}$ can be achieved.\nThus, we have proved that the minimum value of $k$ such that $V_1 = kV_2$ is $\\frac{4}{3}$.\nNow, let $\\theta$ be the angle subtended by a diameter of the base of the cone at the vertex of the cone.

Point O is our origin of reference whose coordinates are (0,0). \nLet our point P be on the axis of symmetry at z distance from the origin O. \nThe coordinates of the points A,B,C,D,E,F and P are given in the figure. \nNow, \nSlope of the line $PC= (z-0)/(0-c/2) =  -2z/c$\nSlope of the line $PB= (z-h)/(0-a/2) = -2(z-h)/a$\nSince the leg BC subtends a right angle at P, the angle BPC should be a right angle. This means that the product of the slope of PC and PB is -1. \ni.e \n$4z(z-h)=-ac$\nor $z^2 - zh + ac/4= 0$\nNow, solving for z, we get,  $z=  [(h + ( h^2 - ac ) ^1/2 ]/2$  and   $[(h - ( h^2 - ac ) ^1/2 ]/2$\nSo, z is the distance of the points from the base  CD.. \nAlso the points are possible only when , $h^2 - ac >= 0$.. and doesn't exist for $h^2 -ac <0$\n"

We then have $x+y = -z$; $xy = (x+y)^2$.  This gives us $x^2 + xy + y^2 = 0$.  Mutiplying both sides by $(x-y)$, we have $x^3 - y^3 = 0$.  Since we want $x,y$ to be real, this implies $x = y$.  But $x^2 + x^2 + x^2$ can only equal 0 when $x=0$ (which, in this case, implies $y,z = 0$).  Hence there are no positive solutions when $a = 0$.\nWhen $a \\neq 0$, we divide $(**)$ by $(*)$ to obtain the system of equations\n\n$\\begin{matrix} (x+y)+z &= a \\; \\quad \\\\ (x+y)-z &= b^2/a \\end{matrix}$,\n\nwhich clearly has solution $x+y = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}$, $z = \\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}$.  In order for these both to be positive, we must have positive $a$ and $a^2 > b^2$.  Now, we have $x+y = \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}$; $xy = \\left(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right)^2$, so $x,y$ are the roots of the quadratic $m^2 - \\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}m + \\left(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{2a}\\right)^2$.  The [discriminant](/wiki/index.php/Discriminant) for this equation is\n\n$\\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\left(2\\frac{a^2 -b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 = \\frac{ (3a^2 - b^2)(3b^2 - a^2) }{4a^2}$.\n\nIf the expressions $(3a^2 - b^2), (3b^2 - a^2)$ were simultaneously negative, then their sum, $2(a^2 + b^2)$, would also be negative, which cannot be.  Therefore our quadratic's discriminant is positive when $3a^2 > b^2$ and $3b^2 > a^2$.  But we have already replaced the first inequality with the sharper bound $a^2 > b^2$.  It is clear that both roots of the quadratic must be positive if the discriminant is positive (we can see this either from $\\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 > \\left(\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\\right)^2 - \\left(2\\frac{a^2 -b^2}{2a}\\right)^2$ or from [ Descartes' Rule of Signs](/wiki/index.php/Polynomial#Descartes.27_Law_of_Signs)).  We have now found the solutions to the system, and determined that it has positive solutions if and only if $a$ is positive and $3b^2 > a^2 > b^2$.

Solving these we get that the left hand side is defined for $x\\in \\left[ -1,1 \\right]$.\nNow obviously the function $f(x)=\\sqrt{\\sqrt{3-x}-\\sqrt{x+1}}$ is continuous on $\\left[ -1,1 \\right]$, with $f(-1)=\\sqrt 2$ and $f(1)=0$.\nMoreover, as $3-x$ is a decreasing and $x+1$ an increasing function, both $\\sqrt{3-x}$ and $-\\sqrt{x+1}$ are decreasing functions, and hence $f(x)$ is a decreasing function. Therefore there is exactly one solution to $f(x)=\\dfrac{1}{2}$.\nWe can now find this solution:\n\\begin{align*} \\sqrt{\\sqrt{3-x}-\\sqrt{x+1}} &= \\dfrac{1}{2} \\\\ \\sqrt{3-x}-\\sqrt{x+1} &= \\dfrac{1}{4} \\\\ \\sqrt{3-x} &= \\dfrac{1}{4} + \\sqrt{x+1} \\\\ 3-x &= \\dfrac 1{16} + x+1 + \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x+1}}2 \\\\ 2 - 2x - \\dfrac 1{16} &= \\dfrac{\\sqrt{x+1}}2 \\\\ 31 - 32x &= 8\\sqrt{x+1} \\\\ 1024 x^2 - 1984x + 961 &= 64(x+1) \\\\ 1024 x^2 - 2048x + 897 &= 0 \\end{align*}\n(Note the little trick in the third row: placing the square roots on opposite sides of the equation. Squaring the equation in the second row would work as well, but this way is a little more pleasant, as the one remaining square root after the squaring will essentially be one of the original two, not their product.)\nSolving the quadratic equation for $x$, we get\n\\[x_{1,2}=\\dfrac{ 2^{11} \\pm \\sqrt{ 2^{22} - 2^{12}\\cdot 897} }{2^{11}} = 1 \\pm \\dfrac{\\sqrt{127}}{32}\\]\nThe reason why we got two roots is that while solving the original equation we squared both sides twice, and this could have created additional solutions.

This is rather trivial, since all lines in 3D space may take the parametric form $(at+n, bt+m, ct+p)$, with $t$ being time, and the average of two such lines must also have a linear parametric form.  \nThe locus clearly starts at the midpoint of $AB'$, or the center of face $ABB'A'$.  As $X$ moves from $A$ to $B$, and $Y$ moves from $C'$ to $C$, both $X$ and $Y$ move along straight lines, so the midpoint of $XY$ traces out a line segment, starting at the midpoint of $AB'$ and ending at the midpoint of $BC'$, or the center of face $BCC'B'$.  This concludes the first phase of motion.  A quick check reveals that the locus goes nowhere during the second and fourth phases of motion, and only moves backward on the third.

of the larger spheres at $(0,0,-2r_c)$ with a radius of $\\sqrt{3}r_c$\nThen, the other three larger spheres which are the same size as the sphere with center at $C_1$ are congruent and tangent to their respective sides near the other faces of the tetrahedron.  \nand this proves that a tetrahedron with any circumradius $r_c$ will have these 5 spheres, one with radius $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}r_c$, at the center of the tetrahedron and the other 4 with radius $\\sqrt{3}r_c$ at centers that are at a distance of $3r_c$ away from any of the vertices of the tetrahedron in the direction from that vertex to the center of its opposite face.\nThus these five spheres exist for any regular tetrahedron.\n~Tomas Diaz. orders@tomasdiaz.com\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Then the right angle's vertex must lie on the circle with diameter $AX$.  So, for a particular $X$, the desired locus is a circle with diameter $AX$.  Accounting for all possible $X$, the total locus is the union of the circumferences of all circles that have a diameter $AX$, where $X$ is some point on $BC$.  \nAs $X$ moves from $B$ to $C$, the motion of the circle with diameter $AX$ is continuous and fluid.

Therefore the original right inequality is always satisfied, and all $x$ such that the original inequality is satisfied are in the interval $[\\pi/4, 7\\pi/4]$.\n\n\n\n**1965 IMO** (**Problems**) \u2022 [Resources](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c3222)\n\n\nPreceded\u00a0by**First Question**\n\n1 **\u2022** [2](/wiki/index.php/1965_IMO_Problems/Problem_2) **\u2022** [3](/wiki/index.php/1965_IMO_Problems/Problem_3) **\u2022** [4](/wiki/index.php/1965_IMO_Problems/Problem_4) **\u2022** [5](/wiki/index.php/1965_IMO_Problems/Problem_5) **\u2022** [6](/wiki/index.php/1965_IMO_Problems/Problem_6)\n\nFollowed\u00a0by**Problem 2**\n\n\n** All IMO Problems and Solutions**\n"

If $x_2$ or $x_3$ is 0, then the other is clearly zero, so let's consider the case where neither are 0. $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ are negative, so exactly one of $x_2$ or $x_3$ is positive. Unfortunately this means that one of $a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3$ or $a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$ is positive and the other is negative, so the equation couldn't possibly be satisfied if $x_2$ or $x_3$ isn't 0. We have covered the case where one of the $x_i$ is 0, now let's assume that none of them are 0.\nIf two are positive and one is negative, then when the negative $x_i$ is paired with one of the positive $a_i$, the corresponding equation is negative. This is bad. If two are negative and one is positive, then when the positive $x_i$ is paired with one of the positive $a_i$, the corresponding equation is positive. This is also bad. Therefore the $x_i$ all have the same sign.\nCase 1: The $x_i$ are all positive. WLOG $x_1\\leq x_2\\leq x_3$. Now consider the third equation, $a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$. Therefore $x_2(a_{31} +a_{32}+a_{33})+ a_{31}(x_1-x_2)+a_{33}(x_3-x_2)= 0$, but all of the terms on the LHS are non-negative and the first one is positive, so this is impossible.\nCase 2: The $x_i$ are all negative. WLOG $x_1\\geq x_2\\geq x_3$. Consider the third equation, $a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$.

The sides are k/(k+1) times smaller, so vol APWX = k3(k+1)3 vol ABCD. The base of the prism WXPBYZ is BYZ which is similar to BCD with sides k/(k+1) times smaller and hence area k2(k+1)2 times smaller. Its height is 1/(k+1) times the height of A above ABCD, so vol prism = 3 k2(k+1)3 vol ABCD. Thus vol ABWXYZ = (k3 + 3k2)/(k+1)3 vol ABCD.

Since $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, $b|a^2c$. Note that if $b$ is between $a$ and $c$, then $b$ is relatively prime to $a$ and $c$, and $b$ cannot possibly divide $a^2c$. Therefore $b$ is either the least of the three consecutive integers or the greatest.\nAssume that $b$ is the least of the three consecutive integers. Then either $b|b+2$ or $b|(b+2)^2$, depending on if $a=b+2$ or $c=b+2$. If $b|b+2$, then $b$ is 1 or 2. $b$ couldn't be 1, for if it was then the triangle would be degenerate. If $b$ is 2, then $b(a^2+c^2-b^2)=42=a^2c$, but $a$ and $c$ must be 3 and 4 in some order, which means that this triangle doesn't exist. therefore $b$ cannot divide $b+2$, and so $b$ must divide $(b+2)^2$. If $b|(b+2)^2$ then $b|(b+2)^2-b^2-4b=4$, so $b$ is 1, 2, or 4. Clearly $b$ cannot be 1 or 2, so $b$ must be 4. Therefore $b(a^2+c^2-b^2)=180=a^2c$. This shows that $a=6$ and $c=5$, and the triangle has sides that measure 4, 5, and 6.\nNow assume that $b$ is the greatest of the three consecutive integers. Then either $b|b-2$ or $b|(b-2)^2$, depending on if $a=b-2$ or $c=b-2$. $b|b-2$ is absurd, so $b|(b-2)^2$, and $b|(b-2)^2-b^2+4b=4$. Therefore $b$ is 1, 2, or 4. However, all of these cases are either degenerate or have been previously ruled out, so $b$ cannot be the greatest of the three consecutive integers.\nThis shows that there is exactly one triangle with this property - and it has side lengths of 4, 5, and 6. $\\blacksquare$\n\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Then we can hinge triangles ACD and BCD about CD to vary AB. The extreme values evidently occur with A, B, C, D coplanar. The least value, 0, when A coincides with B, and the greatest value \u221a3, when A and B are on opposite sides of CD. We rule out the extreme values on the grounds that the tetrahedron is degenerate, thus obtaining 0 < a < \u221a3.\nFor k = 5, the same argument shows that 0 < 1 < \u221a3 a, and hence a > 1/\u221a3.\nFor k = 2, there are two possible configurations: the sides length a adjacent, or not. Consider first the adjacent case. Take the sides length a to be AC and AD. As before, the two extreme cases gave A, B, C, D coplanar. If A and B are on opposite sides of CD, then a = \u221a(2 - \u221a3). If they are on the same side, then a = \u221a(2 + \u221a3). So this configuration allows any a satisfying \u221a(2 - \u221a3) < a < \u221a(2 + \u221a3).\nThe other configuration has AB = CD = a. One extreme case has a = 0. We can increase a until we reach the other extreme case with ADBC a square side 1, giving a = \u221a2. So this configuration allows any a satisfying 0 < a < \u221a2. Together, the two configurations allow any a satisfying: 0 < a < \u221a(2 + \u221a3).\nThis also solves the case k = 4, and allows any a satisfying: a > 1/\u221a(2 + \u221a3) = \u221a(2 - \u221a3).\nFor k = 3, any value of a > 0 is allowed. For a <= 1, we may take the edges length a to form a triangle. For a \u2265 1 we may take a triangle with unit edges and the edges joining the vertices to the fourth vertex to have length a.\n"

It follows that the normals to the hypotenuse AB at the tangency points S, T of the circles $K_2, K_3$ are tangent to the incircle $K_1$.

Similarly, we define the directed distance between two of a family of parallel lines in a plane.)\nThe problem can be rewritten as follows: Given four distinct parallel planes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, $p_4$ in space, prove that there exists a regular tetrahedron XYZW such that $X\\in p_1$, $Y\\in p_2$, $Z\\in p_3$, $W\\in p_4$.\nIn order to do this, it is enough to find a regular tetrahedron ABCD somewhere in space and four parallel planes $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$ such that $A\\in q_1$, $B\\in q_2$, $C\\in q_3$, $D\\in q_4$ and $d\\left(q_1;\\;q_2\\right): d\\left(q_2;\\;q_3\\right): d\\left(q_3;\\;q_4\\right)=d\\left(p_1;\\;p_2\\right): d\\left(p_2;\\;p_3\\right): d\\left(p_3;\\;p_4\\right)$. In fact, once we have found such a tetrahedron ABCD and such planes $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$, then, because of $p_1\\parallel p_2\\parallel p_3\\parallel p_4$, $q_1\\parallel q_2\\parallel q_3\\parallel q_4$ and $d\\left(q_1;\\;q_2\\right): d\\left(q_2;\\;q_3\\right): d\\left(q_3;\\;q_4\\right)=d\\left(p_1;\\;p_2\\right): d\\left(p_2;\\;p_3\\right): d\\left(p_3;\\;p_4\\right)$, there exists a similitude transformation which maps the planes $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$ to the planes $p_1$, $p_2$, $p_3$, $p_4$; this similitude transformation will then obviously map the regular tetrahedron ABCD with $A\\in q_1$, $B\\in q_2$, $C\\in q_3$, $D\\in q_4$ to a regular tetrahedron XYZW with $X\\in p_1$, $Y\\in p_2$, $Z\\in p_3$, $W\\in p_4$; hence, the existence of such a tetrahedron XYZW will be proven, and the problem will be solved.\nSo consider a regular tetrahedron ABCD lying arbitrarily in space; we try to find four parallel planes $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$ such that $A\\in q_1$, $B\\in q_2$, $C\\in q_3$, $D\\in q_4$ and $d\\left(q_1;\\;q_2\\right): d\\left(q_2;\\;q_3\\right): d\\left(q_3;\\;q_4\\right)=d\\left(p_1;\\;p_2\\right): d\\left(p_2;\\;p_3\\right): d\\left(p_3;\\;p_4\\right)$.\nIn fact, we start working in the plane ABC.

Let $g_2$ be the line BT, and let $g_1$ and $g_3$ be the parallels to the line $g_2=BT$ through the points A and C, respectively. Then, the lines $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$ are parallel and, by Thales, $d\\left(g_1;\\;g_2\\right): d\\left(g_2;\\;g_3\\right)=AT: TC$. Thus, $d\\left(g_1;\\;g_2\\right): d\\left(g_2;\\;g_3\\right)=d\\left(p_1;\\;p_2\\right): d\\left(p_2;\\;p_3\\right)$. Now, denote by $g_4$ the line in the plane ABC which is parallel to the lines $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$ and satisfies $d\\left(g_1;\\;g_2\\right): d\\left(g_2;\\;g_3\\right): d\\left(g_3;\\;g_4\\right)=d\\left(p_1;\\;p_2\\right): d\\left(p_2;\\;p_3\\right): d\\left(p_3;\\;p_4\\right)$.\nNow, let $q_4$ be the plane passing through the line $g_4$ and the point D. Let $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$ be the planes parallel to $q_4$ and passing through the lines $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$, respectively (of course, we can construct such planes since the lines $g_1$, $g_2$, $g_3$ are parallel to $g_4$). Thus, we have found four parallel planes $q_1$, $q_2$, $q_3$, $q_4$ such that $A\\in q_1$, $B\\in q_2$, $C\\in q_3$, $D\\in q_4$, and these planes obviously satisfy $d\\left(q_1;\\;q_2\\right): d\\left(q_2;\\;q_3\\right): d\\left(q_3;\\;q_4\\right)=d\\left(g_1;\\;g_2\\right): d\\left(g_2;\\;g_3\\right): d\\left(g_3;\\;g_4\\right)$.

If equation $P(x)=1$ with more than three integer points (ie.. at least $4$) then equation $(P(x))^2=1$ implies $P(x)=1$ so $m\\leq n$, ie... $m-n\\leq 0\\leq2$. The same case for equation $P(x)=-1$. So $m\\leq 6$. If $n\\geq4$ then $m-n\\leq 6-n\\leq 2$. Now assume that $n=3$. In this case if $m\\leq 5$ then $m-n\\leq 2$.\nSo let us show that $m<6$. In fact if $m=6$ then $P(x)-1=0$ has three integers distince roots, and the same for $P(x)+1=0$. So\n$P(x)-1=k_1(x-a_1)(x-a_2)(x-a_3)$ and $P(x)+1=k_2(x-b_1)(x-b_2)(x-b_3)$ where $a_i$ distince and $b_j$ distince and all with $k_1,k_2$ are integers!

So $k_1=k_2=k$.\nFinally, we have\n$2=k(a_i-b_1)(a_i-b_2)(a_i-b_3)$ for $i=1,2,3$ and because that $\\pm1$ can not presents as products of three distince numbers so $k=\\pm1$, we may assume $k=1$. Because $2=(-2)\\cdot 1\\cdot -1$ so\n$\\{-2,1,-1\\}=\\{a_i-b_1,a_i-b_2,a_i-b_3\\}$\nThis means $3a_i-(b_1+b_2+b_3)=-2+1-1=-2$. So we must have $3a_1=3a_2=3a_3$ which follows $a_1=a_2=a_3$, which contracts!. So $m\\leq 5$ and we're done.\n\nThe above solution was posted and copyrighted by pluricomplex.

                "text": "Determine the greatest number, who is the product of some positive integers, and the sum of these numbers is $1976.$\n\n### Solution 1\nSince $3*3=2*2*2+1$, 3's are more efficient than 2's. We try to prove that 3's are more efficient than anything:\nLet there be a positive integer $x$. If $3$ is more efficient than $x$, then $x^3<3^x$. We try to prove that all integers greater than 3 are less efficient than 3:\nWhen $x$ increases by 1, then the RHS is multiplied by 3. The other side is multiplied by $\\dfrac{(x+1)^3}{x^3}$, and we must prove that this is less than 3 for all $x$ greater than 3.\n$\\dfrac{(x+1)^3}{x^3}<3\\Rightarrow \\dfrac{x+1}{x}<\\sqrt[3]{3}\\Rightarrow 1<(\\sqrt[3]{3}-1)x$\n$\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3}-1}<x$\nThus we need to prove that $\\dfrac{1}{\\sqrt[3]{3}-1}<4$. Simplifying, we get $5<4\\sqrt[3]{3}\\Rightarrow 125<64*3=192$, which is true. Working backwards, we see that all $x$ greater than 3 are less efficient than 3, so we never use anything greater than 3. Therefore we use as many 3s in groups of 2 as possible, and since the remainder when 1976 is divided by 6 is 2, we can use 658 3s and one 2.\n$\\dfrac{1976}{3}=658.6666$, so the greatest product is $\\boxed{3^{658}\\cdot 2}$.\n### Solution 2\n(Non-rigorous)\nWe demonstrate heuristically that 3's are the most efficient. \nAs we know that the chosen numbers must be equal, by the AM-GM inequality, we wish to maximize \\[f(x) = \\left(\\frac{1976}{x}\\right)^{x}\\]\nSimple logarithmic differentiation shows that $\\frac{S}{x} = e$ maximizes the given function. As $e$ is approximately 2.71828, we use 2's and 3's only. 3's are optimal, but we must use one 2.\n### Solution 3\nNote:  This solution uses the same strategy as Solution 1 (that having the largest possible number of three's is good), but approaches the proof in a different manner.\nLet $f(S) \\triangleq \\prod_{x \\in S} x$, and $g(S) = \\sum_{x\\in S} x$, where $S$ is a multiset.  We fix $g(S) = 1976$, and aim to maximize $f(S)$.  Since $3(x-3) > x$ for $x \\geq 5$,  we notice that $S$ must only contain the  integers $1,2,3$ and $4$.  We can replace any occurrences of $4$ in $S$ by replacing it with a couple of $2$'s, without changing $f(S)$ or $g(S)$, so we may assume that $S$ only contains the integers $1,2$ and $3$.   We may further assume that $S$ contains at most one $1$,  since any two $1$'s can be replaced by a $2$ without changing $g(S)$, but with an increase in $f(S)$.  If $S$ contains exactly one $1$, then it must also contain at least one $2$ (since $1976 \\equiv 2\\;(\\mathrm{mod }\\;3)$).   We can then replace this pair of a $1$ and a $2$ with a $3$, thus keeping $g(S)$ constant, and increasing $f(S)$.   Now we may assume that $S$ contains only $2$'s and $3$'s.   \nNow, as observed in the last solution, any triplet of $2$'s can be replaced by a couple of $3$'s, with $g(S)$ constant, and an increase in $f(S)$.    Thus, after repeating this operation, we will be left with at most two $2$'s.  Since $g(S) = 1976$, and $1976 \\equiv 2\\;(\\mathrm{mod }\\;3)$,  we therefore get that $S$ must have exactly one $2$ (since we already showed it consists only of $2$'s and $3$'s).   Thus, we get $\\boxed{f(S) = 2\\cdot 3^{658}}$.\n"

Define the sequence $a_n$ similarly, except that $a_0>k$, by the reasoning above, there is a $a_m$ such that $f(a_m)=1$, by the inductive assumption, this means that $a_m=f(a_{m-1}-1)=1$, we can repeat the inductive assumption to get that $a_{m-k+1}=k$. This implies that $f(a_{m-k}-1)=k$. Thus, there is a $t$ such that $f(t)=k$.\nNow for that $t$, we have $k>f(f(t-1))$, which means that $k+1>t$ by the inductive assumption which implies $t=k$ since we must have $t>k-1$, otherwise $f(t)<k$.

Three of the segments $A_2B_l, (l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)$, say $A_2B_i,A_2B_j,A_2B_k$,have to be of the same color, let it w.l.o.g. be red. Then $A_1B_i,A_1B_j,A_1B_k$ must be green. At least one of the sides of triangle $B_iB_jB_k$, say $B_iB_j$ ,must be an edge of the prism. Then looking at the triangles $A_1B_iB_j$ and $A_2B_iB_j$ we deduce that $B_iB_j$ can be neither green nor red, which is acontradiction. Hence all five edges of the pentagon $A_1A_2A_3A_4A_5$ have thesame color. Similarly, all five edges of $B_1B_2B_3B_4B_5$ have the same color.We now show that the two colors are the same.

We now count the diagonal segments by grouping the red segments based on their $A$ point, and the green segments based on their $B$ point. As above, the assumption that three of $A_iB_j$ for fixed $i$ are red leads to a contradiction. Hence at most two diagonal segments out of each $A_i$ may be red, which counts up to at most $10$ red segments. Similarly, at most $10$ diagonal segments can be green. But then we can paint at most $20$ diagonal segments out of $25$, which is a contradiction.

Let A' be the other intersection of the 2 circles different from the point A. Since the angles $\\angle BO_1A = \\angle CO_2A$ are equal, the isosceles triangles $\\triangle AO_1B \\sim \\triangle AO_2C$ are similar. Consequently, the angles $\\angle BAO_1 = \\angle CAO_2$ are equal and the angles\n$\\angle BAC = BAO_1 + \\angle O_1AO_2 + \\angle O_2AC =$\n$= BAO_1 + \\angle O_1AO_2 - \\angle CAO_2 = \\angle O_1AO_2$\nare also equal. The angles $\\angle A'BA = \\frac{\\angle A'O_1A}{2} = \\angle O_2O_1A$ are equal and the angles $\\angle A'CA = \\frac{\\angle A'O_2A}{2} = \\angle O_1O_2A$ are also equal. As a result, the point A' is on the side BC of the triangle $\\triangle ABC$, which is always similar to the fixed triangle $\\triangle O_1AO_2$.\nLemma (Yaglom's Geometric Transformations II, pp 68-69). Assume that a figure F' (the triangle $\\triangle ABC$) moves in such a way that it remains at all times similar to a fixed figure F (the triangle $\\triangle O_1AO_2$) and in addition, some point of the figure F' does not move at all (the point A). If a point B of the figure F' describes a curve $\\Gamma$ (the circle $(O_1)$), then any other point M of the figure F' describes a curve $\\Gamma'$ similar to the curve $\\Gamma$.\nConsequently, the midpoint M of the segment BC decribes a circle (Q). When the points B, C, become identical with the point A, the midpoint M of BC also becomes identical with A. Hence, the circle (Q) passes through the point A. The line BC always passes through A'. Just after the start of motion counter-clockwise, the points B, C, A' follow on the line BC in this order. The points B, C both pass through the point A' one after another and just before the end of one period of motion, the points A', B, C follow on the line BC In this order. From the continuity principle, the midpoint M of BC also passes through the point A' and consequently, the circle (Q), the locus of the midpoints M, also passes through the point A'. Thus the circle (Q) belongs to the same pencil with the circles $(O_1), (O_2)$ and it is centered on their center line $O_1O_2$. Let p be the perpendicular bisector of the segment BC intersectong the circle (Q) at a point P different from the point M. The point A' and the circle (Q) passing through this point are fixed and the angle $\\angle A'MP = 90^\\circ$ is right. Therefore, A'P is a fixed diameter of the circle (Q), which means that the point P is also fixed. Q.E.D.\nWhen the points B, C are both diametrally opposite to the point A on their respective circles, the segment $O_1O_2$ is the midline of the triangle $\\triangle ABC$, i.e., $BC \\parallel O_1O_2$, $BC \\perp AA'$. The cyclic quadrilateral AA'MP inscribed in the circle (Q) is then a rectangle. Its circumcenter Q is the intersection of its diagonals AM, A'P intersecting at their midpoint and the midpoint of AM is identical with the midpoint of $O_1O_2$. Thus the fixed point P is the reflection of the intersection A' of the circles $(O_1), (O_2)$ in the midpoint Q of the segment $O_1O_2$.\nThis solution was posted and copyrighted by yetti.

For some value of $k$ between 1 and $n$, inclusive, we say that the second 1 will occur in the $(k+1)$th place.  Clearly, there are ${k \\choose 1}$ ways to arrange the bits coming before the second 1, and ${n-k \\choose r-1}$ ways to arrange the bits after the second 1.  Our identity follows.\nSince the sum of the least elements of the sets is ${n+1 \\choose r+1}$, the mean of the least elements is $\\frac{{n+1 \\choose r+1}}{{n \\choose r}} = \\frac{n+1}{r+1}$, Q.E.D.\n### Solution 2\nWe proceed as in the previous solution, but we prove our identity using the following manipulations:\n\n$\\begin{matrix}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}k{n-k \\choose r-1 } &=&\\sum_{k=1}^{n-(r-1)}{k}{n-k \\choose r-1}\\\\ &=& \\sum_{i=1}^{n-(r-1)}\\sum_{k=i}^{n-(r-1)}{n-k \\choose r-1}\\\\ &=&\\sum_{i=1}^{n-(r-1)}{n-i+1 \\choose r}\\\\ &=&{n+1 \\choose r+1} \\end{matrix}$\n\nQ.E.D.\n### Solution 3\nWe proceed by strong induction.\nWe define $F(k, k-1)$ to be zero (the empty sum).\nWe consider $r$ to be fixed.  The assertion obviously holds for $r = n$.  We now assume the problem to hold for values of $n$ less than or equal to $k$.  By considering subsets containing $k+1$ and not containing $k+1$, respectively, we conclude that\n\n$F(k+1, r) = \\frac{{k \\choose r-1}F(k,r-1) + {k \\choose r}F(k,r)}{{k+1 \\choose r}} = 1 + \\frac{k-r+1}{r+1} = \\frac{k+2}{r+1}$.\n\nThis completes our induction, Q.E.D.\n### Solution 4\nConsider a bipartite graph $G$ with bipartition $\\{A,B\\}$. The vertices in $A$ are the $(r+1)$-element subsets of $\\{0, \\dots , n\\}$, and the vertices in $B$ are the $r$-element subsets of $\\{1, \\dots , n\\}$, and we draw an edge $\\overline{ab}$ iff the subset $b \\in B$ may be obtained from $a \\in A$ by deleting the smallest element in $a$. \nNote that \n\n$|A|=\\binom{n+1}{r+1}, |B|=\\binom{n}{r}, |E(G)|=\\binom{n+1}{r+1}=\\frac{n+1}{r+1} \\binom{n}{r}.$\n\nThe degree of a vertex in $B$ is the value of the least element of its corresponding subset. Hence \\[F(n,r)=\\frac{1}{\\binom{n}{r}} \\sum_{v \\in B} \\deg (v)= \\frac{n+1}{r+1}.\\]\n### Solution 5\nWe will count how many times each element of the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$ appear as the smallest element in a set, which will lead us to the result. \nTo count how many times $1$ appears as the smallest element of a subset, we need to choose an $r-1$ element subset from the remaining $n - 1$ numbers, as all of them are greater than $1.$ There are simply $\\dbinom{n - 1}{r - 1}$ ways to do this. \nSimilarly, to count how many times $2$ appears as the smallest element, we need to choose an $r - 1$ element subset from the remaining $n - 2$ numbers greater than $2.$ There are $\\dbinom{n - 2}{r - 1}$ ways to do this. \nAs there are $\\dbinom{n}{r}$ subsets, and thus smallest elements, in total, it now becomes clear that we need to evaluate the sum \\[\\frac{\\binom{n - 1}{r - 1} + 2\\binom{n - 2}{r - 1} + \\cdots + (n - r + 1)\\binom{r - 1}{r - 1}}{\\binom{n}{r}}.\\] We can rearrange this sum as \\[\\frac{\\left(\\binom{n - 1}{r - 1} + \\binom{n - 2}{r - 1} + \\cdots + \\binom{r - 1}{r - 1}\\right)+\\left(\\binom{n - 2}{r - 1} + \\binom{n - 3}{r - 1} + \\cdots + \\binom{r - 1}{r - 1}\\right)+\\cdots+ \\binom{r-1}{r-1}}{\\binom{n}{r}}.\\] Using the Hockey Stick Identity on each of the smaller sums on the numerator gives us \\[\\frac{\\binom{n}{r} + \\binom{n - 1}{r} + \\binom{n-2}{r} + \\cdots + \\binom{r}{r}}{\\binom{n}{r}}.\\] Using Hockey stick again gives us \\[\\frac{\\binom{n + 1}{r + 1}}{\\binom{n}{r}},\\] which simplifies to \\[\\frac{\\frac{(n + 1)!}{(r + 1)!(n-r)!}}{\\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}} = \\left(\\frac{(n + 1)!}{(r + 1)!(n - r)!}\\right) \\left(\\frac{r!(n-r)!}{n!}\\right) = \\frac{n + 1}{r + 1},\\] as desired. \nSolution by Ilikeapos\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

We show first that $f(3) = 1$. $f(1)$ must be $0$, otherwise $f(2) - f(1) - f(1)$ would be negative. Hence $f(3) = f(2) + f(1) + 0$ or $1$ = $0$ or $1$. But we are told $f(3) > 0$, so $f(3) = 1$. It follows by induction that $f(3n) >= n$. For $f(3n+3) = f(3) + f(3n)$ + $0$ or $1 = f(3n) + 1$ or $2$. Moreover if we ever get $f(3n) > n$, then the same argument shows that $f(3m) > m$ for all $m > n$. But $f(3.3333) = 3333$, so $f(3n) = n$ for all $n <= 3333$.

This gives \\[\\frac{x^2}{y}-x+\\frac{y^2}{z}-y-z+\\frac{z^2}{x}\\geq0.\\] We move the negative terms to the right, giving \\[\\frac{x^2}{y}+\\frac{y^2}{z}+\\frac{z^2}{x}\\geq x+y+z.\\] We rewrite this as \\[\\sum_{cyc}\\frac{x^2}{y}\\geq\\sum_{cyc}rx+(1-r)y.\\] where $r$ is any real number. (This works because if we evaulate the cyclic sum, then as long as the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ on the right sum to 1 the right side will be $x+y+z$.\nThus, we need to show that there exists a real number $r$ such that $\\frac{x^2}{y}\\geq rx+(1-r)y$ for all positive $x,y$. We claim that $r=2$ works. This becomes $\\frac{x^2}{y}\\geq2x-y$, and since $y$ is positive we can multiply by $y$ to yield $x^2\\geq2xy-y^2$, or $(x-y)^2\\geq0$, which is obviously true by the Trivial Inequality. Thus, we are done with part (a).\n(To clarify how this works, we have $\\frac{x^2}{y}\\geq 2x-y$, $\\frac{y^2}{z}\\geq 2y-z$, and $\\frac{z^2}{x}\\geq 2z-x$, we add these inequalities to get $\\frac{x^2}{y}+\\frac{y^2}{z}+\\frac{z^2}{x}\\geq x+y+z.$)\nEquality occurs if and only if $\\frac{x^2}{y}=2x-y$, $\\frac{y^2}{z}=2y-z$, and $\\frac{z^2}{x}=2z-x$ at the same time, since if they are not all equal then the left side will be greater than the right side. From there, it is easy to see that the equality case is $x=y=z$, which is $a=b=c$.\n~john0512\n"

Then $\\angle DTA = \\frac{ \\pi - \\angle DAB}{2} = \\angle DCO$, so $DCOT$ is a cyclic quadrilateral and $T$ is in fact the $T$ of the previous solution.  The conclusion follows.\n### Solution 3\nLet the circle have center $O$ and radius $r$, and let its points of tangency with $BC, CD, DA$ be $E, F, G$, respectively.  Since $OEFC$ is clearly a cyclic quadrilateral, the angle $COE$ is equal to half the angle $GAO$.

It follows that\n\n${EB} + CE + DG + GA = AO + OB$,\n\nQ.E.D.\n### Solution 4\nWe use the notation of the previous solution.  Let $X$ be the point on the ray $AD$ such that $AX = AO$.  We note that $OF = OG = r$; $\\angle OFC = \\angle OGX = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$; and $\\angle FCO = \\angle GXO = \\frac{\\pi - \\angle BAD}{2}$; hence the triangles $OFC, OGX$ are congruent; hence $GX = FC = CE$ and $AO = AG + GX = AG + CE$.  Similarly, $OB = EB + GD$.  Therefore $AO + OB = AG + GD + CE + EB$, Q.E.D.\n### Solution 5\nThis solution is incorrect.

It follows, if O is the center of the circle, that\n$\\angle{OEC}=\\angle{OED}=90\\deg$\nSince $AO=EO=BO$, we obtain two squares, $AOED$ and $BOEC$.\nFrom the properties of squares we now have\n\n$AD+BC=AO+BO=AB$\n\nas desired.\n### Solution 6\nLemma. Let $I$ be the in-center of $ABC$ and points $P$ and $Q$ be on the lines $AB$ and $BC$ respectively. Then $BP + CQ = BC$ if and only if $APIQ$ is a cyclic quadrilateral.\nSolution.

(That is, the values of $x_1$ which make $x_{n+1}$ \"work\"). We must prove these intervals intersect at one point.\nFirst, I prove they intersect. Notice that as $x_1$ increases, $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ do too. So if $I_n=(a_n,b_n)$ it is easy to see $a_n=x_1$ will give $x_n=x_{n+1}=1-1/n$ and $b_n=x_1$ will give $x_{n+1}=1$ (the \"extremal\" values $x_{n+1}$ can take are given by the extremal values $x_1$ can take).\nBut if $a_n=x_1$ we see that $x_{n+1} \\textless 1-1/(n+1)$ and so $x_{n+1} \\textgreater x_{n+2}$ and similarly $x_1=b_n$ gives $x_{n+1}=1$ which gives a $x_{n+2}$ too big. So basically when $x_1$ only barely works for $x_{n+1}$, it won't work for $x_{n+2}$. So $I_{n+1}$ is a subset of $I_n$.\nSo we have an infinite sequence of open intervals, each contained inside the previous one. Therefore their intersection must contain at least one number. This guarantees the existence of $x_1$.\nBut, we must prove that $x_1$ can't take two different values. Suppose it could. Suppose $x_1=a,b$ both work. Let $x_i$ be the sequence generated by $a$ and $x_i'$ the sequence generated by $b$, and let $l_i=x_i'-x_i$ (wlog $a \\textless b$).

By above, there's exactly one $y_1$ with $f_{n+1}(y_1)<y_{n+1}$, and notice that $y_1>x_1=c$ by the monotonicity of $f_{n+1}$. This means that there exists $y_1>c\\in A$, contradicting the definition of glb.

What we must prove is that we can color the edge set of a bipartite graph in two colors s.t. the difference between the number of red edges and white edges adjacent to each vertex is $\\le 1$ in absolute value. It suffices to prove this for connected bipartite graphs, since then we can apply the result to each connected component of the graph.\nIf all the vertices have even degree, then we can find an eulerian circuit. The graph is bipartite, so this circuit has an even number of edges, and we can thus color the edges in the circuit alternatively red and white so that two edges which are consecutive in the circuit have different colors. It's clear that this coloration satisfies the requirements.\nIf, on the other hand, the graph has $2k>0$ vertices with odd degre, then we partition the edge set into $k$ paths, and in each path we color the edges alternatively red and white.

Clearly there are a total of $n*(n+1)/2$ such lines representing the total number of elements of the union where each vertex is connected to $n$ vertices, meaning each of the $n$ elements of $A_i$ is part of $1$ other subset.\nStarting with $i = 1$, let us start coloring all lines joining vertices $A_i$, $A_{i+1}$ with color Red, all lines joining $A_i$, $A_{i+2}$ with color White, $A_i$, $A_{i+3}$ with color Red, $A_i$, $A_{i+4}$ with color White and so on ... $A_i$, $A_{i+n/2}$ with color White.\nClearly each line from vertex $A_i$ alternates Red, White for first $n/2$ lines and then alternates White, Red for remaining $n/2$ lines implying that we could have exactly $n/2$ red lines emanating from each vertex $A_i$. But these $n/2$ lines represent $n/2$ elements of each subset $A_i$ which could each be assigned a value of $0$.  This completes the proof.\n- Kris17\n\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

We proceed by induction, because given $f(1)=f(2)=1$ and $f(3)=3$, we can determine all other values, and this property holds for $f(1)$, $f(2)$, and $f(3)$.\nWe prove that all operations conserve this property. For $f(2n)=f(n)$, we are adding a zero at the end, thus obviously preserving this property. For $f(4n+1) = 2f(2n+1)-f(n)$, we see that letting $4n+1=\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k01}_2$ gets that assuming this holds true for $f(2n+1)$ and $f(n)$, then\\[f(4n+1) = 2f(2n+1)-f(n)=2f(\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k1}_2)-f(\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k}_2)\\]\\[= 2 \\cdot\\overline{1a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2 - \\overline{a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2 = \\overline{10a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2\\]which keeps the property since $\\overline{10a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2$ is the reversal of $\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k01}_2$ in binary. Similarly, letting $4n+1=\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k11}_2$, then\\[f(4n+3) = 3f(2n+1)-2f(n)=3f(\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k1}_2)-2f(\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k}_2)\\]\\[= 3 \\cdot\\overline{1a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2 - 2 \\cdot \\overline{a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2 = \\overline{11a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2\\]which keeps the property since $\\overline{11a_ka_{k-1}\\ldots a_2a_1}_2$ is the reversal of $\\overline{a_1a_2\\ldots a_k11}_2$. Due to this, we have proved that this property holds for all $n$ which means we need to find the number of binary palindromes below $1988$. This number is just going to be, for $n<11$-digit numbers, $2^{\\lfloor \\frac {n-1}2 \\rfloor}$ ways, so summing up for less than $11$ digits gets $62$ ways. For $11$-digit numbers, we have $32$ ways but need to subtract a few in which are greater than $1988$; there are two numbers we don't count, namely $2015$ and $2047$. As a result, our answer is $62+30=\\boxed{92}$.\nThis solution was posted and copyrighted by kevinmathz.

On the values of $x$ between $n$ and $n+1$ for $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ $1\\le n\\le 69$, the terms of the form $\\frac{k}{x-k}$ for $k\\ne n,n+1$ have a finite range.  In contrast, the term $\\frac{n}{x-n}$ has an infinite range, from $+\\infty$ to $n$.  Similarly, the term $\\frac{n+1}{x-n-1}$ has infinite range from $-n-1$ to $-\\infty$.  Thus, since the two undefined values occur at the distinct endpoints, we can deduce that $f(x)$ takes on all values between $+\\infty$ and $-\\infty$ for $x\\in(n,n+1)$.  Thus, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, we are garunteed a $n<r_n<n+1$ such that $f(r_n)=\\frac{5}{4}$.  Additionally, we have that for $x>70$, the value of $f(x)$ goes from $+\\infty$ to $0$, since as $x$ increases, all the terms go to $0$.  Thus, there exists some $r_{70}>70$ such that $f(r_{70})=\\frac{5}{4}$ and so $f(x)\\ge\\frac{5}{4}$ for $x\\in(70,r_{70})$.  \nSo, we have $70$ $r_i$ such that $f(r_i)=\\frac{5}{4}$.  There are obviously no other such $r_i$ since $f(x)=\\frac{5}{4}$ yields a polynomial of degree $70$ when combining fractions.  Thus, we have that the solution set to the inequality $f(x)\\ge\\frac{5}{4}$ is the union of the intervals $(n,r_n]$ (since if $f(x)<\\frac{5}{4}$ for $x\\in(n,r_n)$ then there would exist another solution to the equation $f(x)=\\frac{5}{4}$. \nThus we have proven that the solution set is the union of disjoint intervals.  Now we are to prove that the sum of their lengths is $1988$.\nThe sum of their lengths is $r_1+r_2+\\cdots+r_{70}-(1+2+\\cdots+70)=r_1+r_2+\\cdots+r_{70}-35\\cdot71$.  We have that the equation $f(x)=\\frac{5}{4}$ yields a polynomial with roots $r_i$.  Thus, opposite of the coeficient of $x^{69}$ divided by the leading coefficient is the sum of the $r_i$.  It is easy to see that the coefficient of $x^{69}$ is $-5(1+2+\\cdots+70)-4(1+2+\\cdots+70)=-9\\cdot35\\cdot 71$.  Thus, since the leading coefficient is $5$ we have $r_1+r_2+\\cdots+r_{70}=9\\cdot7\\cdot71$.  Thus, the sum of the lengths of the intervals is $63\\cdot71-35\\cdot71=28\\cdot71=1988$ as desired.\n"

Thus, the area of the hexagon is equal to $[ABC]+\\sum\\frac{1}{4}a^2\\left(\\frac{2r}{b+c-a}\\right)$.  \nNow we shall find the area of triangle $A_0B_0C_0$.  It is obvious that the points $A_1,B,C_1$ are collinear since the angle the make at $B$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(180-B)+\\frac{1}{2}(180-B)+B=180$, and similarly for the other points.  Thus, it suffices to find the area of each of the triangles $A_0BC$.  It is well known that $A_0$ is the center of the excircle $O_a$ with radius $R_a=r\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{b+c-a}\\right)$.  Thus the area of triangle $A_0BC$ is $\\frac{1}{2}ar\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{b+c-a}\\right)$ and so the area of triangel $A_0B_0C_0$ is $\\sum\\frac{1}{2}ar\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{b+c-a}\\right)$.  \nNow we can prove that $A_0B_0C_0 = 2 \\cdot$ area of hexagon $AC_1BA_1CB_1$ by simplifying.  We have \n$A_0B_0C_0 -2 \\cdot$ area of hexagon $AC_1BA_1CB_1$\n$=-[ABC]+\\sum\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ar\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{b+c-a}\\right)-\\frac{1}{2}a^2\\left(\\frac{2r}{b+c-a}\\right)\\right)$\n$=-[ABC]+\\sum\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ar\\left(\\frac{a+b+c-2a}{b+c-a}\\right)\\right)$\n$=-[ABC]+\\sum\\left(\\frac{1}{2}ar\\right)$\n$=0$\nas desired.\nAs for the inequality, notice that it is equivalent to \n$[ABC]+\\sum\\frac{1}{2}ar\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{b+c-a}\\right)\\ge 4[ABC]$\n$\\Leftrightarrow \\sum\\frac{1}{2}ar\\left(\\frac{a+b+c}{b+c-a}\\right)\\ge \\frac{3}{2}r(a+b+c)$\n$\\Leftrightarrow \\sum\\frac{a}{b+c-a}\\ge 3$\nLetting $a=x+y,b=y+z,c=z+x$ for $x,y,z$ positive reals, the inequality becomes\n$\\sum\\frac{x+y}{2z}\\ge 3$\n$\\Leftrightarrow \\sum\\frac{x+y+z}{z}\\ge 9$\nwhich is true by AM-HM.\n"

Since $AB=AD+BC$, the intersection of circle $A$ with the line $AB$ is the same as the intersection of circle $B$ with the line $AB$.  Thus, the two circles are externally tangent to each other.  \nNow draw the circle with center $P$ and radius $h$.  Since $h$ is the shortest distance from $P$ to $CD$, we have that the circle $P$ is tangent to $CD$.  From the conditions $AP=h+AD$ and $BP=h+BC$, by the same reasoning that we found circles $A,B$ are tangent, we find that circles $P,A$ and $P,B$ are externally tangent also.  \nFix the two externally tangent circles with centers $A$ and $B$ and let the points $C$ and $D$ vary about their respective circles (without loss of generality, assume that one can read the letters $ABCD$ in counter clockwise order).  Notice that the value $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{AD}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{BC}}$ is fixed.  Thus, in order to prove the claim presented in the problem, we must maximize the value of $h$.  It is clear that all possible circles $P$ are contained within the region created by circles $A,B$ as well as their common tangent line.  Now it is clear that $h$ is maximized when circle $P$ is tangent to the common tangent of circles $A,B$ as well as to the circles $A,B$.

If $j > i + 1$, then $|F_i \\cap F_j| = 2n \\cdot (2n - 2) \\cdot (2n - 4)!$ (there are $2n$ choices for $x_i, x_{i+1}$, $2n - 2$ for $x_j, x_{j+1}$, and $(2n - 4)!$ for everything else.)\nHow often is $|F_i \\cap F_j| \\neq 0$? We know $i$ is at least $1$ and at most $2n - 3$, and for any value of $i$, there are $2n - 2 - i$ possible values for $j$.

Using $f(f(1)) = f(1)$ again, we see that $f(f(f(1))) = f(f(1)) = f(1) = 1$. Now plugging in $x = 1$ we get $f(f(y)) = \\frac{1}{y}$. Such a function can not be continuous as if $f(x)$ is increasing or decreasing on some observable interval, $f(f(x))$ will be increasing on that interval but $\\frac{1}{x}$ is decreasing on all positive intervals. This indicates the function is discrete which means we can assign a \"4-chain\" of $f(a) = b$, $f(b) = \\frac{1}{a}$, $f(\\frac{1}{a}) = \\frac{1}{b}$, and $f(\\frac{1}{b}) = a$. It is obvious to see that any function where $f(f(x)) = \\frac{1}{x}$. Must follow such a structure. The problem occurs that we do not know whether our current value of $x$ is a $b$ or an $a$. To make non-trivial progress on this we must split all rational numbers into two sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, such that if $E \\in S_1$ then $\\frac{1}{E} \\in S_1$. As long as $S_1$ and $S_2$ have the same size, so the bijection $f(\\textrm{an element from }S_1)$ = $(\\textrm{an element from } S_2)$ can hold, there will exist a piece-wise function (possibly with a greater than countable infinity number of pieces) that satisfies f(x). \nTo find one of these functions we can limit our searching by proving that $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$. To do this simply set $x = \\frac{1}{f(y)}$ yielding:\n\\newline\n$f(1) = f(f(y) \\times \\frac{1}{f(y)}) = \\frac{f(\\frac{1}{f(y)})}{y} = 1$. This means that $f(x) = y$. Since $X,Y \\in Q+$ there will always be an $x$ that suffices this and a corresponding $y$. Thus $f(ab)$ with $b = f(c)$ $\\leftrightarrow$ $c = \\frac{1}{f(b)}$ expands into $f(af(c)) = \\frac{f(a)}{c} = f(a)f(b)$.\nUtilizing $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$ we can see that if we break-down every ratio into it's prime factorization of the numerator and denominator. Our \"4-chain\" is simply $f(p) = q$, $f(q) = \\frac{1}{p}$, $f(\\frac{1}{p}) = \\frac{1}{q}$, $f(\\frac{1}{q}) = p$ where $p$ and $q$ are unique primes. Thus our 2 sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ is simply 2 sets of equal size containing only primes and their inverse. A good way to do this assuming we aren't given the sequence of all infinite primes (as this would require an explicit formula that does not yet exist) is to split the primes into 2 and 1 mod 6 being in one set with 3 and 5 mod 6 in the other. These sets have equal sizes from a strong form of Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions.\nThus we have created our two sets and to show that this actually works we will let $x = P_1^{E_{1x}} \\times P_2^{E_{2x}} \\times P_3^{E_{3x}} \\times \\dots$ where $P_i$ is a prime and $E_{ix}$ are integers. Define $y$ similarly. For the sake of simplicity if $i$ is odd then $P_i \\in S_1$ and if $i$ is even $P_i \\in S_2$. Where our \"4-chain\" is $f(p_n) = p_{n+1}$, $f(p_{n+1}) = \\frac{1}{p_n}$, $f(\\frac{1}{p_n}) = \\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}$, $f(\\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}) = p_n$ with $n$ being odd. Then $f(y) = P_2^{E_{1y}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2y}} \\times P_4^{E_{3y}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4y}}\\dots$ (remember $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$). \nThen $xf(y) = P_1^{E_{1x} - E_{2y}} \\times P_2^{E_{2x} + E_{1y}} \\times P_3^{E_{3x} - E_{4y}} \\times \\dots$\n$f(xf(y)) = P_2^{E_{1x} - E_{2y}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2x} - E_{1y}} \\times P_4^{E_{3x} - E_{4y}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4x} - E_{3y}} \\dots$\n$f(x) = P_2^{E_{1x}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2x}} \\times P_4^{E_{3x}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4x}}\\dots$\n$\\frac{f(x)}{y} = P_2^{E_{1x}- E_{2y}} \\times P_1^{-E_{2x} - E_{1y}} \\times P_4^{E_{3x} - E_{4y}} \\times P_3^{-E_{4x} - E_{3y}}\\dots$\nThus $f(xf(y)) = \\frac{f(x)}{y}$ QED\n"

If $n_{2k}>1990$ pick the least natural value of m such that $2^m 47\\geq n_{2k}$. The best B can do is half it, taking it to $n_{2k+2} = 2^{m-1} 47 < n_{2k}$. However, B cannot make $n_{2k+2}$ drop below 45 because $47*32<1990 \\Rightarrow 2^m \\geq 64$.

Thus, $a_k=n-1$ and $1+d(k-1)=n-1$ which shows $d(k-1)=n-2$ and so $d$ divides $n-2$. We make two cases.\nCase 1: $n$ is odd. Then $\\gcd(n-2,n)=1$.

Since $\\phi$ is a multiplicative function, observe that $n$ cannot be a multiple of a prime greater than $3$, because for such primes $p$ we have that $\\phi(p^k) = (p-1)p^{k-1} \\ge p-1 > 2$, which is contradiction. Hence, $n$ is just composed of factors of $2$ and $3$. If it divides both, and is of the form $2^m 3^n$ for $m$ and $n$ positive, we get that we need $2^{m} 3^{n-1} = 2$, so $n = 1$ and $m = 1$ in this case. If it is of the form $n = 2^k$, we get $k = 2$. And if it is of the form $3^k$, we get $k = 1$. $3$, $4$, and $6$ are all less than or equal to $6$, so $\\phi(n) > 2$. Now we're almost done. Since $k > 2$, the number $a_3 = 2p-1$ must be in this sequence.

Now consider the following $8$ sets and notice that at least one of these must be a subset of $X$!:\\[\\{2^2,3^2,5^2,7^2,13^2\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times31,3\\times29,5\\times23,7\\times19,11\\times17\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times47,3\\times43,5\\times41,7\\times37,13\\times19\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times41,3\\times37,5\\times31,7\\times29,11\\times23\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times23,3\\times19,5\\times17,7\\times13,11^2\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times43,3\\times41,5\\times37,7\\times31,13\\times17\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times37,3\\times31,5\\times29,7\\times23,11\\times19\\}\\]\\[\\{2\\times29,3\\times23,5\\times19,7\\times17,11\\times13\\}\\]And obviously each of these sets has $5$ elements that are all relatively prime numbers, as desired.\nThis solution was posted and copyrighted by Wave-Particle.

                    "text": "We provide an algorithmic approach for labelling the edges:  We start off with the set $V$ of all vertices in $G$.  For each step in the process we remove a number of vertices from the set $V$ if their exists an edge sorrounding it which is labelled.  Additionally, we shall use up the numbers $1,2,...,k$ in the order from least to greatest. \nHere is the process: Let $u$ be the least number not used yet.  Take the longest path that uses any vertex once formed solely by vertices from $V$ and call it path $P=(v_1,v_2,...,v_n)$.  If $v_1$ has more than one edge, then since $P$ is maximal, it must be connected to some other edge $v_0$ which could be one of the vertices $v_i$ or one of the vertices not in $V$.  Similarly, if $v_n$ has more than one edge, it must be connected to a vertex $v_{n+1}$ which is either one of the $v_i$ or one of the vertices not in $V$.  Notice that since $v_1,v_n\\in V$ the edge connecting $v_0$ and $v_1$ and the edge connecting $v_n$ and $v_{n+1}$ are not labelled.  Now, if $v_0$ exists, we shall label the edge joining $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ with the number $u+i$.  If $v_0$ does not exist then we shall label the edge joining $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ with the number $u+i-1$.  \nIf $v_0$ or $v_{n+1}$ does not exist, then the vertex they should have been connected to has degree 1, and so the labels of the edges sorrounding it do not matter.  Otherwise and the case of any other vertex in the path, our process garuntees that the vertex will be sorrounded by two edges labelled by 2 consecutive numbers.  Thus, that vertex will be sorrounded by edges whose greates common factor is 1, no matter how the other edges sorrounding it are labelled.  Notice that from our definition of $V$, the edges $v_1,v_2,...,v_n$ are removed from $V$.  Thus, it is clear that all vertices not in $V$, at any time, have edges sorrounding them that are relatively prime.  \nWe repeat the process described until the only vertices in $V$ are those which are not connected to any other vertices in $V$.  Let the least number we have not yet used by $u$.  If any of them are of degree 1, we do not care.  If there is a vertex $v$ of degree at least 2, then we simply label 2 of its edges $u$ and $u+1$ and now its edges are relatively prime, and we can remove it from $V$.  Notice that this doesn't remove any other vertices from $V$ since $v$ is not connected to any vertices from $V$.  We continue like this for the other vertices in $V$.\nNow, all the vertices in $V$ are those whose edges do not matter, while all vertices not in $V$ are those with edges relatively prime.  Thus we have the desired configuration, and we simply distribute the remaining numbers in any way we wish.\n"

Then the length of the smallest height of $ABC$ is that of the height from vertex $A$.  This has a value of $\\frac{2[ABC]}{a}$.  Similarly, for triangles $ABX,BCX,CAX$ we have that the length of the smallest height is twice the area of the respective triangle divided by the longest side of that triangle.  It is clear that since $a$ is the longest side of $ABC$, no two points within $ABC$ have distance exceeding $a$.  Thus, since $X$ is within $ABC$, the longest side of any of the triangles $ABX,BCX,CAX$ does not exceed $a$.  So, we have\n$m(ABX)+m(BCX)+m(CAX)\\ge\\frac{2[ABX]}{a}+\\frac{2[BCX]}{a}+\\frac{2[CAX]}{a}$\n$=\\frac{2[ABC]}{a}=m(ABC)$\nas desired.    \nNow on to prove the assertion for $X$ outside the triangle $ABC$.  We shall assume without loss of generality that out of the points $A,B,C$ point $A$ is that farthest from $X$.  \nIf $ABCX$ is concave or a degenerate quadrilateral, assume without loss of generality that $B$ inside or on triangle $ACX$.  We shall prove that $m(ACX)\\ge m(ABC)$ to prove the main claim.  If the shortest height of $ACX$ was from vertex $A$ then it is clear that the height of $ABC$ from $A$ is smaller than that since ray $CB$ is closer to $A$ than ray $CX$.  The case of the height from $C$ being the smallest of triangle $ACX$ is analogous, so we move on to the case of the height from $X$ is the smallest.  If this is the case, then it is clear that the height of $ABC$ from $B$ is smaller than $m(ABC)$ since $\\angle XAC\\ge \\angle BAC$. Thus the claim is proved.\nIf, instead, $ABCX$ is convex, we can assign the letter $D$ to represent to point of intersection of $AX$ and $BC$.  Before proving the main claim, we shall prove that for triangle $ABX$ we have $m(ABX)\\ge m(ABD)$.  We prove this by considering each of the vertices that the shortest height of $ABX$ is on.  If the shortest height is that from $X$, then it is obvious that the height from $D$ to side $AB$ is smaller than that from $X$ since $D$ is closer to $A$ than $X$ is and so $m(ABX)\\ge m(ABD)$.  If the shortest height of $ABX$ was from $B$, then since the height from $B$ to $XD$ is equal to the height from $B$ to $AD$, we have $m(ABX)\\ge m(ABD)$.  If instead the shortest height of $ABX$ was from $A$, the it is clear that $\\angle B<90$.  Thus, the projection of $A$ onto $BD$ is on the same side of $B$ as $C$.  Now it is obvious that the height of $ABD$ from $A$ is smaller than that of $ABX$ from $A$ since the ray $BD$ is closer to $A$ than the ray $BX$.  Thus, we have $m(ABX)\\ge m(ABD)$ in all cases.  Notice that the case for triangle $ACX$ is analogous.  Therefore, we have $m(ABX)+m(ACX)\\ge m(ABD)+m(ACD)$.  But, this is the case of $D$ on the triangle $ABC$, and this case was shown in the first part of this proof.\nSo, we have that $m(ABC) \\leq m(ABX) + m(AXC) + m(XBC)$ is true in all cases, as desired.\n"

So $S(2^n+2)=\\{2^n+3,...,2^{n+1}\\} \\cup \\{2^{n+1}+1,2^{n+1}+2,2^{n+1}+3,2^{n+1}+4\\}$ but the last set has the only T-number $2^{n+1}+3$. We conclude that:\n$f(2^n + 2)=f(2^n)+1$Now consider $k=2^n +2^r + 2^s$ with $n>r>s\\ge 0$ and $n\\ge 2$. \nWe explicitly calculate f(k) for such numbers.\nSo we have to calculate how many T-numbers are in the set $S(k)=\\{2^n +2^r + 2^s+1;...;2^{n+1} +2^{r+1} + 2^{s+1}\\}$. \nThe T-numbers less than $2^{n+1}$ in $S(k)$ are $T_1 = \\{2^n +2^j + 2^i\u00a0: (j=r \\wedge r>i>s) \\vee  (n>j>r \\wedge j>i>0) \\}$ \nwhence $\\# (T_1)= r-s-1 + \\sum_{h=r+1}^{n-1} h$.\nThe T-numbers greater than $2^{n+1}$ in $S(k)$ are $T_2 = \\{2^{n+1} +2^j + 2^i\u00a0: (j=r+1 \\wedge s+1 \\ge i\\ge 0) \\vee  (r\\ge j \\ge 1 \\wedge j>i \\ge 0) \\}$ \nwhence $\\# (T_2)= s+2 + \\sum_{h=1}^{r} h$.\nTherefore  $S(k)$ contains $\\# (T_1) + \\# (T_2)=r-s-1 + s+2 + \\sum_{h=1}^{r}h  +\\sum_{h=r+1}^{n-1} h = \\sum_{h=1}^{n-1} h + r + 1$ T-numbers and we have: \n$f(2^n +2^r + 2^s)=f(2^n) + r +1$ where $r=1,2,...,n-1$ ans $r > s \\ge 0$ .Summarizing \n$f(2^{n+1}) = f(2^n)+n$\n$f(2^n + 2)=f(2^n)+1$\n$f(2^n +2^r + 2^s)=f(2^n) + r +1$ where $r=1,2,...,n-1$ and $r > s \\ge 0$ .That's to say that f takes all the values from $f(2^n)$ to $f(2^{n+1})$ for every $n \\ge 2$ and\nthen takes any positive integer value since $f(4)=1$ and $f(2^n)$ becomes arbitrarily large.\n**b) one-from-one values**\nBy the fact that $f(2^n +2^r + 2^s)=f(2^n) + r +1$ where $r=1,2,...,n-1$ and $r > s \\ge 0$ \nit follows that each of the values $f(2^n) + r +1$ where $r=2,...,n-1$  come from at least two different k because there are at least two different choices for $s$. These values are $f(2^n)+3,f(2^n)+4,...,f(2^n)+n=f(2^{n+1})$.\nThus the only possible one-from-one values are $f(2^n)+1$ that come from $k=2^n + 2$ and $f(2^n)+2$ that come from $k=2^n + 3$.\nIf $k=2^n + 3$ we have $f(k)=f(k+1)$ because k+1 is not T and $2k+1=2^{n+1} + 7$ and $2k+2=2^{n+1} + 8$ are not T so f maps $2^n + 3$ and $2^n + 4$ to $f(2^n)+2$.\nIf $k=2^n + 2$ then  $f(k+1)=f(2^n)+2>f(k)=f(2^n)+1>f(k-1)=f(2^n+1)=f(2^n)$. \nThe function f is non-decreasing.\nIt is sufficient to prove that $f(k+1) \\ge f(k)$ but this follows by the fact that if k+1 is T then 2k+2 is T too. \nBy the monotonicity of f $f( 2^n + 2)=f(2^n)+1=\\tbinom n2 +1= n(n-1)/2 + 1$ with $n \\ge 2$ are the only one-from-one values of f.\n### Solution 2\n**a) Surjectivity of f**\nFor space-time saving we say that a positive integer is a T-number or simply is T if it has exactly three 1s in his base two representation and define the sets $S(k)=\\{k+1;k+2;...;2k\\}$.\nSo $f(k)$ is the number of T-numbers in $S(k)$.\nA positive even integer 2n is T iff n is T.(Fundamental theorem of T numbers)(FTT)\nThe function f is non-decreasing.\nIt is sufficient to prove that $f(k+1) \\ge f(k)$. This follows by (FTT) if k+1 is T then 2k+2 is T too; so passing from $S(k)$ to $S(k+1)$ we can loose a T-number $k+1$ but we regain it with $2k+2$ in $S(k+1)$ so $f(k+1)$ cannot be less than $f(k)$. We also have $f(k+1) \\le f(k) + 1$. This would be false if $k+1$ were not T and both $2k+1$ and $2k+2$ were T. But if $2k+2$ were T then $k+1$ would be T too by the (FTT).\nThen we have $f(k) \\le f(k+1) \\le f(k) + 1$ that is $f(k+1)=f(k)$ or $f(k+1)=f(k)+1$.\nBut $f(4)=1$ and $f(2^n)= \\tbinom n2$ so f takes all of the positive integer values because starting from 1 with step of 1 reaches arbitrarily large integer values.\n**b) one-from-one values of f**\nThe one-from-one values $f(k)$ are such that $f(k)=f(k-1)+1$ and $f(k+1)=f(k)+1$ since f is monotone non-decreasing and has step 1.\nBy the condition $f(k+1)=f(k)+1$ since $k+1$ is T iff $2k+2$ is T we have that $2k+1$ must be T.\nBy the condition $f(k)=f(k-1)+1$ since $k$ is T iff $2k$ is T we have that $2k-1$ must be T.\nThen $2k-1$ and $2k+1$ must have the form $2^{n+1}+2^{r+1}+1$ with $n>r\\ge 0$ since they are odd and $n \\ge 2$ since there is only 1 T-number less than 8 and they must have the same number of bits since their diferrence is 2 and both are T (the only two binary numbers wich differs by 2 and have different number of bits are $2^n+1$ and $2^n-1$ or $2^n$ and $2^n-2$ which are evidently not T). Let $2k+1=2^{n+1}+2^{j+1}+1$ and $2k-1=2^{n+1}+2^{i+1}+1$ with $j>i \\ge 0$. Then $2k+ 1-(2k-1)=2^{j+1}-2^{i+1}=2$ that is $j=1$ and $i=0$.\nWe conclude that $f(k)$ is one-from-one for $k=2^n+2^j=2^n+2$ with $n \\ge 2$.\nSince $f(2^n+1)=f(2^n)=\\tbinom n2$ we have that $f(2^n+2)=\\tbinom n2 +1= n(n-1)/2 + 1$ with $n \\ge 2$ are the only one-from-one values of f.\n\n"

The result now follows.\nNote: $ab + bc + ca = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c}$, because $abc = 1$. (Why? Because $a = \\frac{1}{bc}$, and hence $\\frac{1}{a} = bc$).\n~th1nq3r\n\nScroll all the way down\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

If that condition is true, then $(x_i,y_i) \\in S$\n\nNow let's look at a case (c1) where $(x_i,y_i) \\in S$ and $x_i \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$, thus $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$:\nc1 subcase 1\u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 9,y_i \\pm 4)$:\n$(x_i \\pm 9) \\equiv (0 \\pm 9)\\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$\nand $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i \\pm 4}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\pm 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv (0 \\pm 1) \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$\nsince $x_{i+1} \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil  \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$ for this subcase.\nc1 subcase 2\u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 4,y_i \\pm 9)$:\nThis move is not allowed because the only values of $1 \\le y_i \\le 12$ such that $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$ are $5,6,7,8$.  Adding or subtracting 9 from any of these numbers will either make $y_{i+1}<0$ or $y_{i+1}>12$ and will put the piece outside of the board.\nIn summary, for case (c1), $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$\n\nNow let's look at a case (c2) where $(x_i,y_i) \\in S$ and $x_i \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$, thus $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$:\nc2 subcase 1\u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 9,y_i \\pm 4)$:\n$(x_i \\pm 9) \\equiv (1 \\pm 9)\\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$\nand $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i \\pm 4}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\pm 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv (1 \\pm 1) \\;(mod \\; 2)\\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$\nsince $x_{i+1} \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil  \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$ for this subcase.\nc2 subcase 2\u00a0: $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1})=(x_i \\pm 4,y_i \\pm 9)$:\n$(x_i \\pm 4) \\equiv (1 \\pm 4)\\;(mod \\; 2) \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$\nNotice that the only values of $1 \\le y_i \\le 12$ such that $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_i}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 0 \\;(mod \\; 2)$ are $1,2,3,4,9,10,11,12$.  Adding 9 to the values of 1,2, or 3 or subtracting 9 from the values of 10, 11, or 12, will result in $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$.  However, subtracting 9 from the values of 1,2, or 3, or adding 9 for the values of 10,11, or 12 will put the piece outside the board and not a valid move.  Furthermore, for the values of 4 and 9, adding or subtracting 9 from them will result in the piece being outside of the board and not a valid move.  Therefore for all valid moves in this subcase which are 9 added to 1, 2, or 3 or 9 subtracted from 10, 11, or 12, the result will be $\\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1 \\;(mod \\; 2)$\nsince $x_{i+1} \\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{y_{i+1}}{4} \\right\\rceil  \\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$ for this subcase.\nIn summary, for case (c2), $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$\nTherefore if $(x_{i},y_{i}) \\in S$ then $(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}) \\in S$\nNow we look at the starting point: $(1,1)$:\nSince $1 \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $(1,1) \\in S$ and all subsequent squares after that $\\in S$\nNow let's look at the end point: $(20,1)$:\nSince $20 \\equiv 0\\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $\\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rceil \\equiv 1\\;(mod \\; 2)$, then $20 \\not\\equiv \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{4} \\right\\rceil \\;(mod \\; 2)$ and $(20,1) \\not\\in S$\nSince $(20,1) \\not\\in S$, then there are no valid moves starting from $(1,1)$ that will end in $(20,1)$\nTherefore the task cannot be done when $r=97$.\n~Tomas Diaz. orders@tomasdiaz.com\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Likewise, the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $B$ is the same as the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $D$.\nThis color pattern and the fact that the midpoint $M$ has integer coordinates indicates that triangle $ABC$ has the same color pattern as triangle $CDA$ rotated 180 degrees.\nTherefore, the white area in triangle $ABC$ is the same as the white area in triangle $CDA$ and the black area in triangle $ABC$ is the same as the black area in triangle $CDA$.\nThus $S_{1}=\\frac{T_{1}}{2}$ and $S_{2}=\\frac{T_{2}}{2}$, which gives $f(m,n)=\\frac{g(m,n)}{2}=0$\nTherefore $f(m,n)=0$ when both $m$ and $n$ are even.\ncase: $m$ and $n$ which are both odd\nSince $m$ and $n$ are both odd, the total area of the rectangle $ABCD$ is $m \\times n$ which is also odd\nSince the total area is odd, then $\\frac{mn}{2}$ is not an integer but $\\frac{mn+1}{2}$ and $\\frac{mn-1}{2}$ are.\nThis means that in the rectangle there are $\\frac{mn+1}{2}$ squares of one color and $\\frac{mn+1}{2}$ squares of the other color\n$g(m,n)=|T_{1}-T_{2}|=\\left| \\frac{mn+1}{2}-\\frac{mn-1}{2} \\right|=1$\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of line $AC$.  Them $M$ is at coordinate $(A_{x}+\\frac{m}{2},A_{y}+\\frac{n}{2})$  Since both $m$ and $n$ are odd, then $M$ has non-integer coordinates coordinates but their decimal portions are both $0.5$. This means that $M$ lies in the middle of the center square.\nStarting with vertex $A$, because the length of $AB$ is odd, then the color for the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $B$ is the same color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $A$, then starting with vertex $B$, because the length of $BC$ is odd, then the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $C$ is the same color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $B$.  this means that the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $A$ is the same as the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $C$.  Likewise, the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $B$ is the same as the color of the square inside rectangle $ABCD$ closest to $D$.\nThis color pattern and the fact that the midpoint $M$ in in the center of the middle square that triangle $ABC$ has the same color pattern as triangle $CDA$ rotated 180 degrees.\nTherefore, the white area in triangle $ABC$ is the same as the white area in triangle $CDA$ and the black area in triangle $ABC$ is the same as the black area in triangle $CDA$.\nThus $f(m,n)=\\frac{g(m,n)}{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$\nTherefore $f(m,n)=\\frac{1}{2}$ when both $m$ and $n$ are odd.\nTo summarize part (a), \n$f(m,n)=\\begin{cases} 0 & m,n\\;are\\;both\\;even \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & m,n\\;are\\;both\\;odd\\\\ something \\; else & othwerwise\\end{cases}$\n\n**Part (b)**\nSince $f(m,n)=\\begin{cases} 0 & m,n\\;are\\;both\\;even \\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & m,n\\;are\\;both\\;odd\\\\ something \\; else & othwerwise\\end{cases}$ then for these cases the minimum values that $m$ and $n$ can have are 1.  So for the cases where both are odd or both are even $f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2} max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ with equality at $m=n=1$\nNow we need to find the case were one of them is odd and the other one is even.\ncase $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even, means that $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1$ is even\nTherefore $f\\left( max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)=0$\n$f(m,n)=f\\left( max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\})$,\nwhere $h(1,n)$ is the absolute value of the difference between the white area and black area of a triangle with base or size 1 and height n where this triangle is not necessarily a rectangular triangle.\nTherefore $h(1,n) \\le$ area of such triangle.  Thus, $h(1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le \\frac{1}{2}min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$\n$f\\left( max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le 0 +\\frac{1}{2}min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$\n$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ when $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even\nWhich also means that\n$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ when $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd and $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even\nNow we look at the case where $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd, means that $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1$ is even\nTherefore $f\\left( min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)=0$\n$f(m,n)=f\\left( min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\})$,\nThus, $h(1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$\n$f\\left( min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}-1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\} \\right)+h(1,max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}) \\le 0 +\\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$\n$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ when $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even and $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd\nTherefore, for all four cases: $m$ and $n$ are both odd; $m$ and $n$ are both even; $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd with $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even; and $max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is even with $min\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ is odd we have:\n$f(m,n) \\le \\frac{1}{2}max\\left\\{ m,n \\right\\}$ with equality at $m=n=1$\n\n**Part (c)**\nConsider the case where $m=k$ and $n=k+1$ and k is even.\n$f(m,n)=f(k,k+1)=f(k,k)+h(k,1)=h(k,1)$\nWe're going to calculate $h(k,1)$ noticing that the region for $h(k,1)$ in $f(m,n)$ will be the triangle formed by lines $y=kx$, $y=\\frac{k+1}{k}x$ and $x=k$.\nSo, to calculate $h(k,1)$ we first calculate the total area of the black triangular regions within the triangle (assuming the first corner is white) with the following series formula:\n$S_{1}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{k+1}{k}j-j \\right)\\left(j- \\frac{k}{k+1}j \\right)=\\sum_{j=1}^{k}\\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{k+1-k}{k} \\right)\\left( \\frac{k+1-k}{k+1} \\right)j^{2}$\n$S_{1}=\\frac{1}{2k(k+1)}\\sum_{j=1}^{k}j^{2}=\\frac{1}{2k(k+1)}\\frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}=\\frac{2k+1}{12}$\nThen, $S_{2}=\\frac{k}{2}-S_{1}=\\frac{k}{2}-\\frac{2k+1}{12}=\\frac{4k-1}{12}$\n$h(k,1)=|S_{2}-S_{1}|=\\left| \\frac{4k-1}{12}-\\frac{2k+1}{12}  \\right|=\\frac{k-1}{6}$\nThus for even $k$ we have $f(k,k+1)=h(k,1)=\\frac{k-1}{6}$\nSince for this case, $C=\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} f(k,k+1)=\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{k-1}{6}=\\infty$, then there is no upper bound for this case.  Since part (c) describes an upper bound for all $m$ and $n$, then having found one case where there is no upper bound means that there is no upper bound when considering all $m$ and $n$\nTherefore, there is no constant $C$ such that $f(m,n)<C$ for all $m$ and $n$ because $C \\to \\infty\\;$ on some cases.\n~ Tomas Diaz. orders@tomasdiaz.com\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

We prove this by [induction](/wiki/index.php/Induction) on the number of nonzero $x_i$.\nFirst, suppose that at most two of the $x_i$, say $x_a$ and $x_b$, are nonzero.  Then the left-hand side of the desired inequality becomes $x_a x_b (x_a^2 + x_b^2)$ and the right-hand side becomes $(x_a + x_b)^4/8$.

We wish to show that by replacing the $x_i$ with the $y_i$, we increase the left-hand side of the desired inequality without changing the right-hand side; and then to use the inductive hypothesis.\nWe note that\n\\begin{align*} \\sum_{1\\le i< j \\le n} x_i x_j(x_i^2 + x_j^2) ={}& \\sum_{1 \\le i<j \\le k-1} x_i x_j(x_i^2 + x_j^2) + \\sum_{1 \\le i \\le k-1} \\left[ x_ix_k(x_i^2 + x_k^2) + x_ix_{k+1}(x_i^2 + x_{k+1}^2) \\right] \\\\ & + x_k x_{k+1}(x_k^2 + x_{k+1}^2) \\\\ ={}& \\sum_{1 \\le i<j \\le k-1} x_i x_j(x_i^2 + x_j^2) + \\sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x_i^3 (x_k + x_{k+1}) + S(x_k^3 + x_{k+1}^3) \\\\ &+ x_k^3 x_{k+1} + x_k x_{k+1}^3 \\end{align*}\nIf we replace $x$ with $y$, then $S(x_k^3 + x_{k+1}^3) + x_k^3 x_{k+1} + x_k x_{k+1}^3$ becomes\n\\[S(x_k + x_{k+1})^3 = S(x_k + x_{k+1})^3 + 3S(x_k^2 x_{k+1} + x_k x_{k+1}^2),\\]\nbut none of the other terms change.  Since $3S > S \\ge a_1 \\ge a_k, a_{k+1}$, it follows that we have strictly increased the right-hand side of the equation, i.e.,\n\\[\\sum_{1 \\le i<j \\le n} x_i x_j (x_i^2 + x_j^2) < \\sum_{1 \\le i<j \\le n} y_i y_j (y_i^2 + y_j^2) .\\]\nBy inductive hypothesis,\n\\[\\sum_{1\\le i<j \\le n} y_i y_j (y_i^2 +y_j^2) \\le \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\right)^4 / 8 ,\\]\nand by our choice of $y_i$,\n\\[\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\right)^4/8 = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\right)^4/8 .\\]\nHence the problem's inequality holds by induction, and is strict when there are more than two nonzero $x_i$, as desired.  $\\blacksquare$\n"

By repeated applications of Fermat's Little Theorem:\n$N = 2^n+1 = 2^{p^am} + 1 = (2^{p^{a-1}m})^p + 1 \\equiv 2^{p^{a-1}m} + 1$ (mod $p$)\nContinuing in this manner, and inducting on k from 1 to $a$,\n$2^{p^{a-k}m}+1 \\equiv (2^{p^{a-k-1}m})^p + 1$ (mod $p$) $\\equiv 2^{p^{a-k-1}m} + 1$ (mod $p$)\nSo we have $N \\equiv 2^m+1$ (mod $p$)\nSince $p$ is relatively prime to $m$, $N \\equiv 1+1$ (mod $p$) $\\equiv 2$ (mod $p$)\nSince $p$ is odd, $N$ is not divisible by $p$. Hence $N$ is not divisible by $n$. So we have a contradiction, and our original assumption was false, and therefore $N$ is still not divisible by $n$.\n"

If you have a solution for it, please help us out by [adding it](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php?title=2002_IMO_Problems/Problem_1&action=edit).\n### Proof sketch\nOkay this is going to be really bad because it's going to be one of my first solutions to an IMO problem. I probably don't need this \"proof sketch\" part, but I find IMO solutions to be extremely hard to interpret because they have a million (different) ideas going on with little justification, so here's my thought process going into the problem. Anyway, we can choose to interpret $h+k<n$ graphically by graphing it on the coordinate plane. It turns out that it will just create a right isosceles triangle of lattice points that has legs of length n-1 and a right angle at the origin. This is simple because h and k have to be non negative, or $0$ and above, while h+k<n will make a triangle. However, we can't count the points on the line since it's dotted. A lattice of blue points will look like this:\n{Insert diagram here, preferably at some lower n like n=5}\nSecond, we will consider what happens if we color an arbitrary point red. The problem states that all points with coordinate points equal to less than that arbitrary point will be colored red. Graphically, this means that the point colored red, along with all the points that are in the rectangle containing the origin and point as their corners, will be colored red. Notice how coloring other nontrivial points red will just create a block shape that's all red for the triangle. An example is shown below\n{Insert diagram here, like two rectangles, clearly highlighted points at n=5 along with their respective rectangles}\nLastly, we will consider what it means to find the amount of subsets with different x coordinates and different y coordinates. It's worded really badly, but what it's trying to say is how many ways are there to choose $n$ points with distinct coordinate points. This means that we will have to choose one point from each row or column because you have to choose strictly $n$ points. In other words, to find $A$, the amount of points with distinct x-coordinates, just multiply the amount of blue dots in each row. To find $B$, the amount of points with distinct y-coordinates, just multiply the amount of blue dots in each column. \nIn summary, we need to prove that the product of blue dots in a row is equal to the product of red dots in a column. With some fiddling around, we can guess that we need to prove that there is a bijection between the two sets, which proves that A=B as a consequence.\n### Actual Proof\nLet $a_x$ denote the amount of points with a given x-coordinate. Let $a_y$ denote the amount of points with a given y-coordinate.\n\nLemma: We claim that the elements of the sets of X={$a_x$ | x} and Y={$a_y$ | y} are the same. We will prove this via induction on an arbitrary points colored red.\nStart with the base case, where there are no red points. This is trivial. X=Y={1,2,3,...n} because the amount of points in $a_x=a_y$, or $a_1=a_1$, $a_2=a_2$, etc.\n\nNow for the inductive step. This is not so simple, however. Instead of considering an entire rectangle, we will focus on coloring one point. Call this point $(p,q)$. If we color a point red, then the amount of blue points in row p is going to be $a_x=n-(x+y)-1$, where as $a_y=n-(y+x)-1$. They're both the same! Repeatedly adding a point will give us any shape of red points that we want, or the amount of \"blocky shapes\". (Apparently called a young's tabeulux, idk what that is.) Therefore, we have completed the induction.\n\nMultiplying the elements in a set when their elements are the same means that they are equal. Therefore, $X=Y$ implies $A=B$.\n~Wesserrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr\n"

Call $\\omega$ the circle with diameter $BC$ and $\\odot{AMN}$ the circumcircle of $\\triangle{AMN}$. \nOur ultimate goal is to show that $\\angle{CNR} + \\angle{RMB} = 180^\\circ$. To show why this solves the problem, assume this statement holds true. Call $K$ the intersection point of the circumcircle of $\\triangle{CNR}$ with side $BC$. Then, $\\angle{RKC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{CNR}$, and $\\angle{RKB} = \\angle{CNR}$. Since $\\angle{RMB} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{CNR}$, $\\angle{RKB} + \\angle{RMB}  = 180^\\circ$, implying $K$ also lies on the circumcircle of $\\triangle{BMR}$, thereby solving the problem.\nWe now prove that $\\angle{CNR} + \\angle{RMB} = 180^\\circ$. Note that $ON$ and $OM$ are radii of $\\omega$, so $\\triangle{MON}$ is isosceles. The bisector of $\\angle{MON}$ is thus the perpendicular bisector of $MN$. Since $R$ lies on the bisector of $\\angle{MON}$, $\\angle{ONR} = \\angle{RMO} = k$. Angle computations yield that \\[\\angle{RMN} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{BMO} - \\angle{RMO} - \\angle{AMN}\\] \\[= 180^\\circ - b - k - a,\\] from $\\angle{AMN} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{BMN} = 180^\\circ - (180^\\circ - \\angle{ACB}) = \\angle{ACB}$ and from $\\angle{BMO} = \\angle{MBO} =$ $\\angle{ABC}$.\nThe bisector of $\\angle{BAC}$ hits $\\odot{AMN}$ at the midpoint of the arc $MN$ not containing $A$. This point must lie on the perpendicular bisector of segment $MN$, which is the bisector of $\\angle{MON}$. It follows that $R$ is indeed the midpoint of arc $MN$, so $A$, $M$, $R$, $N$, are concyclic. Since $\\angle{RAN}$ and $\\angle{RMN}$ subtend the same arc $NR$, $\\angle{RAN}$ = $\\angle{RMN}$. With $AR$ being the bisector of $\\angle{BAC}$, we have \\[\\angle{RAN} = \\angle{RMN} = \\tfrac{\\angle{CAB}}{2} = \\tfrac{180^\\circ - a - b}{2} = 90^\\circ - \\tfrac{a}{2} - \\tfrac{b}{2}.\\] We know that $\\angle{RMN} = 180^\\circ - b - k - a$. so we have $180^\\circ - b - k - a = 90^\\circ - \\tfrac{a}{2} - \\tfrac{b}{2}$. Since $\\angle{CNR} = \\angle{CNO} + \\angle{ONR} = a + k$, and $\\angle{RMB} = \\angle{OMB} + \\angle{RMO} = b + k$, we have \\[\\angle{CNR} + \\angle{RMB} = a + k + b + k = a + b + 180^\\circ - a - b = 180^\\circ.\\]\nThe problem is solved.\n$\\textbf{NOTE:}$ We have $\\angle{RKB} + \\angle{KBA} + \\angle{BAK} = 180^\\circ \\implies \\angle{BAK} = 180^\\circ - (180^\\circ - \\angle{RMB})  - \\angle{KBA}$. Noting that $180^\\circ - \\angle{RMB} = 180^\\circ - b - k = 180^\\circ - (90^\\circ - \\tfrac{a}{2} + \\tfrac{b}{2}) = 90^\\circ + \\tfrac{a}{2} - \\tfrac{b}{2}$, we then have \\[\\angle{BAK} = 180^\\circ - (90^\\circ + \\tfrac{a}{2} - \\tfrac{b}{2}) - b = 90^\\circ - \\tfrac{a}{2} - \\tfrac{b}{2}\\] which is indeed the measure of $\\angle{BAR}$. This implies that $K$ lies on the bisector of $\\angle{BAC}$, and from this, it is clear that $K$ must lie on the interior of segment $BC$. Not proving that $K$ had to lie in the interior of $BC$ was a reason that a large portion of students who submitted a solution received a 1-point deduction.\n"

Now, we will prove that if $20\\nmid n$, then there is a multiple of $n$ that is alternating.\nWe claim that there exists a $2k$ digit alternating integer that is a multiple of $2^{2k+1}$ and there exists an alternating integer with at most $k$ digits that is a multiple of $2\\cdot5^k$. We will prove this by induction.\nBase Case: $k=1$\nWe can let the number be $16$.\nInductive Step:\nLet $a$ be a $2k-2$ digit alternating number such that $2^{2k-1}\\mid a$. Since $a$ is even, this means that the first digit of $a$ is odd. Let $b\\cdot2^{2k-1}\\equiv a\\pmod{2^{2k+1}}$, where $b\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. Let $x=16-2b$. We see that $x$ is alternating, so the number $x\\cdot10^{2k-2}+a$ is also alternating. We also have $x\\equiv-2b\\pmod8$.

Let $S$ be the set of digits such that $x\\cdot10^{k-1}+a$ is alternating. We see that either $S=\\{0,2,4,6,8\\}$ or $S=\\{1,3,5,7,9\\}$. In each possible set, each $\\mod5$ residue appears exactly once. Let $a=2\\cdot5^{k-1}\\cdot b$. Then, $x\\cdot10^{k-1}+a=2\\cdot5^{k-1}\\left(x\\cdot2^{k-2}+b\\right)$. Therefore, there exists an $x$ such that $2\\cdot5^k\\mid x\\cdot10^{k-1}+a$, so there exists an alternating integer with at most $k$ digits that is a multiple of $2\\cdot5^k$. If $k$ is even, then $0\\not\\in S$, so it has exactly $k$ digits.\nNow, let $n=2^a\\cdot5^b\\cdot m$. Then, if $20\\nmid n$, then $a<2$ or $b=0$. If $b=0$, then there exists a $2a$ digit alternating integer $x$ that is a multiple of $2^{2a+1}$. Consider the sequence $a_i=x\\cdot\\frac{10^{2ai}-1}{10^{2a}-1}$. Then, the decimal representation of $a_i$ is the result when $x$ is written $i$ times. For any prime $p$ that divides $n$, if $p\\mid10^{2a}-1$, then $\\nu_p\\left(10^{2ai}-1\\right)=\\nu_p\\left(10^{2a}-1\\right)+\\nu_p(i)$, so $\\nu_p(a_i)=\\nu_p(x)+\\nu_p(i)\\geq\\nu_p(i)$. Therefore, there exists an $i$ such that $p^{\\nu_p(n)}\\mid a_{ci}$ for all $c$. If $p\\nmid10^{2a}-1$, then if $i=\\phi(n)$, then $p^{\\nu_p(n)}\\mid10^{2ai}-1$ if $p\\neq2,5$. Since $5\\nmid n$, this means that we only need to make sure $2^a\\mid x\\cdot\\frac{10^{2ai}-1}{10^{2a}-1}$. Since $2^{2a+1}\\mid x$, this means that this is true, so if $5\\nmid n$, then there exists a multiple of $n$ that is alternating.\nIf $a<2$, then there exists an alternating integer $x$ with exactly $2b$ digits that is a multiple of $2\\cdot5^{2b}$. Then, the first digit of $x$ is odd. Let $a_i=x\\cdot\\frac{10^{2bi}-1}{10^{2b}-1}$. Then, if $p\\mid10^{2b}-1$, then $\\nu_p(a_i)\\geq\\nu_p(i)$, so there exists an $i$ such that $p^{\\nu_p(n)}\\mid a_i$. If $p\\nmid10^{2a}-1$, then we can let $i=\\phi(n)$, so $p^{\\nu_p(n)}\\mid a_i$. If $p=5$, then $5^b\\mid5^{2b}\\mid x$, and if $p=2$, then $a=0,1$, so $p^a\\mid x$. Therefore, $n\\mid a_i$ for some $i$.\nTherefore, all positive integers except multiples of $20$ have an alternating multiple.\n"

Suppose that $a_1, \\dotsc, a_k$, $b_1, \\dotsc, b_k$ are integers such that $P(a_j) = b_j$ and $P(b_j) = a_j$ for all indices $j$.  Let the set $\\{ a_1, \\dotsc, a_k, b_1, \\dotsc, b_k \\}$ have $m$ distinct elements.  It suffices to show that $\\deg (P) \\ge m$.\nIf $a_j = b_j$ for all indices $j$, then the polynomial $P(x)-x$ has at least $m$ roots; since $P$ is not linear, it follows that $\\deg P \\ge m$ by the division algorithm.\nSuppose on the other hand that $a_i \\neq b_i$, for some index $i$.  In this case, we claim that $a_j + b_j$ is constant for every index $j$.  Indeed, we note that\n\\[a_j - a_i \\mid P(a_j) - P(a_i) = b_j - b_i \\mid P(b_j) - P(b_i) = a_j - a_i ,\\]\nso $\\lvert a_j - a_i \\rvert = \\lvert b_j - b_i \\rvert$.  Similarly,\n\\[a_j - b_i \\mid P(a_j) - P(b_i) = b_j - a_i \\mid P(b_j) - P(a_i) = a_j - b_i,\\]\nso $\\lvert a_j - b_i \\rvert = \\lvert b_j - a_i \\rvert$.  It follows that $a_j + b_j = a_i + b_i$.\nThis proves our claim.  It follows that the polynomial\n\\[P(x) - \\left( a_i + b_i - x \\right)\\]\nhas at least $m$ roots.  Since $P$ is not linear it follows again that $\\deg P \\ge m$, as desired.  Thus the lemma is proven.  $\\blacksquare$\n**Lemma 2.** If $a$ is a positive integer such that $P^r(a)$ for some positive integer $r$, then $P^2(a) = a$.\nProof.  Let us denote $a_0 = a$, and $a_j = P^j(a)$, for positive integers $j$.  Then $a_0 = a_r$, and\n\\begin{align*} a_1 - a_0 &\\mid P(a_1)- P(a_0) = a_2-a_1 \\\\ &\\mid P(a_2) - P(a_1) = a_3 - a_2 \\\\ &\\vdots \\\\ &\\mid P(a_r)- P(a_{r-1}) = a_1 - a_0 . \\end{align*}\nIt follows that $\\lvert a_{j+1} - a_j \\rvert$ is constant for all indices $j$; let us abbreviate this quantity $d$.  Now, since\n\\[(a_1-a_0) + (a_2-a_1) + \\dotsb + (a_r-a_{r-1}) = a_r-a_0 = 0,\\]\nit follows that for some index $j$,\n\\[a_j - a_{j+1} = -(a_{j+1} - a_{j+2}),\\]\nor $a_j = a_{j+2} = P^2(a_j)$.  Since $a = a_r = P^{r-j}(a_j)$, it then follows that $P^2(a) = a$, as desired.  $\\blacksquare$\nNow, if there are more than $n$ integers $t$ for which $Q(t) = t$, then by Lemma 2, there are more than $n$ integers $t$ such that $P^2(t) = t$, which is a contradiction by Lemma 1.  Thus the problem is solved.  $\\blacksquare$\n\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

We will prove this by induction on $n = n_1 + n_2 + n_3$. If $n = 0$, then the result follows trivially. Say $n > 0$. \nWLOG, we can assume that $n_1 > 0$. \nBy polynomial division over $\\mathbb{R}[y, z][x]$ we can write \\[P = (x - n_1)Q + R.\\] \nSince $x-n_1$ is a monomial, the remainder $R$ must be a constant in $\\mathbb{R}[y, z]$, i.e., $R$ is a polynomial in two variables $y$, $z$. \nPick an element of $S$ of the form $(n_1, y, z)$ and substitute it in the equation.

Assume from now on that $b>a>1$.\nSince $a$ and $b$ are (obviously) co-prime, there must exist integers $c$ and $d$ such that\n\\[ad+bc=1. \\quad(1)\\]\nIn fact, if $c$ and $d$ are such numbers, then $c\\pm ma$ and $d\\mp mb$ work as well for any integer $m$, so we can assume that $c \\in \\left[-\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}\\right]$.\nDefine $n=|ac-bd|$ and let's see why this is a good choice. For starters, notice that $(a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)=n^2+1$.\nIf $c=\\pm\\frac{a}{2}$, from (1) we see that $a$ must divide $2$ and hence $a=2$. This implies, $d=-\\frac{b-1}{2}$ and $n=\\frac{b(b-1)}{2}-2$. Therefore, \n$\\left(b-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = 1/4 + 2(n+2) > 2n$, so $b > \\sqrt{2n}+\\frac{1}{2}$. Finally, $p=b^2+2^2 > 2n+\\sqrt{2n}$ and the case $c=\\pm\\frac{a}{2}$ is cleared.\nWe can safely assume now that\n\\[|c| \\le \\frac{a-1}{2}.\\]\nAs $b>a>1$ implies $b>2$, we have\n\\[|d| = \\left|\\frac{1-bc}{a}\\right| \\le \\frac{b(a-1)+2}{2a} < \\frac{ba}{2a} = \\frac{b}{2},\\]\nso\n\\[|d| \\le \\frac{b-1}{2}.\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[n^2+1 = (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2) \\le p\\left( \\frac{(a-1)^2}{4}+\\frac{(b-1)^2}{4} \\right). \\quad (2)\\]\nBefore we proceed, we would like to show first that $a+b-1 > \\sqrt{p}$. Observe that the function $x+\\sqrt{p-x^2}$ over $x\\in(2,\\sqrt{p-4})$ reaches its minima on the ends, so $a+b$ given $a^2+b^2=p$ is minimized for $a = 2$, where it equals $2+\\sqrt{p-2^2}$. So we want to show that \\[2+\\sqrt{p-4} > \\sqrt{p} + 1,\\]\nwhich is not hard to show for large enough $p$.\nNow armed with $a+b-1>\\sqrt{p}$ and (2), we get\n\\[4(n^2+1)\\le p( a^2+b^2 - 2(a+b-1) )< p( p-2\\sqrt{p} )< u^2(u-1)^2,\\]\nwhere $u=\\sqrt{p}.$\nFinally, \n\\[u^2(u-1)^2 > 4n^2+4 > 4n^2\\Rightarrow u(u-1) > 2n \\Rightarrow  (u-\\frac{1}{2})^2 > 2n+\\frac{1}{4} > 2n \\Rightarrow u > \\sqrt{2n} + \\frac{1}{2} \\Rightarrow  p = u^2 > 2n + \\sqrt{2n}.\\]\nThe proof is complete.\n**Solution 2**\nWe begin with a lemma.\nLemma: For every prime $p \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$, there exists a positive integer $n \\le \\dfrac{p - \\sqrt{p-4}}{2}$ such that $p\\mid n^2 + 1$.\nProof:\nWe know that there must be a solution $x$ to the equation\n\\[x^2+1 \\equiv 0 \\mod{p}\\]\nwith $1 \\le x \\le p-1$.  However, if $x$ is a solution then so is $p-x$, so there must be a solution $x \\le p-1$.  Let $n$ denote this solution and suppose that $n = \\frac{p-k}{2}$.  Then, we have\n\\[\\left(\\dfrac{p-k}{2}\\right)^2 \\equiv -1 \\mod{p}\\]\n\\[k^2 \\equiv -4 \\mod{p}.\\]\nSince $k$ is a positive integer, it follows that $k^2 \\ge p-4$, so we have\n\\[n \\le \\dfrac{p - \\sqrt{p-4}}{2},\\]\nas desired.  The lemma is proven.\n\nSuppose for sake of contradiction that there are only finitely many integers $n_1,n_2,\\dots,n_k$ that work.  Let $p \\equiv 1 \\mod{4}$ be a prime with $p>20$ and such that $p$ is relatively prime to $n_i^2+1$ for all $i$ (the existence of $p$ is guaranteed by the existence of infinitely many primes of the form $4k+1$).  Then, we know that there exists an $N$ such that $N\\le \\dfrac{p - \\sqrt{p-4}}{2}$ and $p | N^2 + 1$ (this last condition shows that $N$ is not among $n_1,n_2,\\dots,n_k$.  We want to show that\n\\[p > 2N + \\sqrt{2N}\\]\n\\[p - 2N > \\sqrt{2N}.\\]\nBut, we know that $p-2N \\ge \\sqrt{p-4}$, so it suffices to show that\n\\[p-4 > 2N\\]\n\\[p - 2N > 4.\\]\nOnce again, it suffices to show that\n\\[\\sqrt{p-4} > 4,\\]\nwhich follows from $p>20$.\nThus, $N$ satisfies the required condition and it follows that there exist infinitely many values of $n$ that satisfy the given condition, as desired.\n"

We are going to proof that this is the only such function. \nWe start with\nLemma. If 1, $a$, $b$ are sides of a non-degenerate triangle then $a=b$.\nProof. In this case $a<b+1$, therefore $a \\le b$. By the same reason, $b \\le a$. Therefore $a=b$.\nLet $u=f(1)$. Now consider the given condition for $a=1$. By Lemma we get that \n $f(b)=f(b+u-1)$ for any $b$.  First, suppose $u>1$. Then $f$ is a periodic function. But then $f$ is bounded by a constant $M$, i.e. $f(x)<M$. Then take, $a>2M$. We get that $a,f(b)$ and $f(b+f(a)-1)$ are sides of the triangle, but the first number is greater than $2M$ and other two are less than $M$, which is imposible. We get the contradiction, so $u$ could not be greater than 1.\nSo $u=f(1)=1$.\nProperty 1. For any $x$\n $f(f(x)) = x$ Proof. Consider the given condition for $a=x$, $b=1$ and use Lemma.\nProperty 2.

When $n = 2$, we consider two cases. If $a_1$ is not in $M$, then the order $a_1, a_2$ will work. If $a_1$ is in $M$, then $a_2$ is not in $M$ and the order $a_2, a_1$ will work. We will assume that the order can be chosen in such a way for all integers $n < k$ for $k \\ge 3$.\nWhen $n = k$, we can assume WLOG that $a_1<a_2< \\ldots <a_k$. We can also assume that the elements of $M$ are distinct, since if two elements are identical, we can treat them as one and use induction on $n = k-1$. We now consider four cases:\n\n**Case 1:** $a_k$ is in $M$ but $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$ are not.\nThere are at most $k-2$ elements in $M$ greater than $a_k$. Then, from our assumption, there exists an order of jumps starting from $a_k$ of lengths $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$ where the first jump is $a_i$ such that the grasshopper will not land in any point in $M$. We can then switch the jumps $a_k$ and $a_i$. Since $a_i$ is not in $M$ and no subsequent jumps result in the grasshopper landing in a point in $M$, this sequence is valid.\n**Case 2:** $a_k$ is not in $M$ but at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$ is.\nThere are at most $k-2$ elements in $M$ greater than $a_k$.

Adding $a_k$ at the beginning of this sequence then results in a valid sequence.\n**Case 3:** $a_k$ is in $M$ and at least one of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$ is.\nConsider the following pairs of distinct integers $(a_1, a_1+a_k), (a_2, a_2+a_k), \\ldots, (a_{k-1}, a_{k-1}+a_k)$. Since at most $k-2$ of these points are in $M$, by the pigeonhole principle, there exists an integer $i$ such that $a_i, a_i + a_k$ are both not in $M$. Since there are at most $k-3$ elements greater than $a_k$, at most $k-3$ elements are greater than $a_i + a_k$. Then, from our assumption, there exists an order of jumps starting from $a_i + a_k$ of lengths $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{i-1}, a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}$ such that the grasshopper will not land in any point in $M$. Adding $a_i, a_k$ at the beginning of this sequence then results in a valid sequence.\n**Case 4:** None of $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k$ are in $M$.\nAssume that there exists no valid sequence - that any order of jumps will result in the grasshopper landing on at least one element in $M$. We can select any element $m_i$ in $M$ and, from our assumption, construct a sequence beginning at some $a_j$ containing $n-1$ jumps $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_{j-1}, a_{j+1}, \\ldots, a_k$ that will not land on any of the other $n-2$ elements in $M$. Since no valid sequence exists, during this sequence of jumps, the grasshopper must land on $m_i$. \nWLOG, we let $m_1 < m_2 < \\ldots < m_{k-1}$. We let $i = 1$ and $j = k$ and use the corresponding sequence that only lands on $m_1$ and no other element in $M$. Let the jump immediately after landing on $m_1$ be $a_x$, where $x < n$. We swap jumps $a_x$ and $a_n$. Now, since $a_n > a_x$, all jumps before $a_n$ will land on a integer less than $m_1$. Since $m_1$ is the smallest element in $M$, none of the jumps before $a_n$ will land on a point in $M$. Since no jumps after $a_n$ will land on an element in $M$ by the construction, the grasshopper must then land on an element $m_y > m_1$ in $M$ after making the jump $a_n$. However, this would imply that the original construction would land on another element $m_y$ different from $m_1$, but this is a contradiction. So, a valid sequence must exist.\n\nSince we have an induction on $n$, the statement must be true for all $n$, and we are done.\n\n"

Then, we see that the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABP$ must be tangent to $SP$ at $P$ by the converse of the radical axis theorem, since $\\omega$ is internally tangent to $\\Gamma$ at $C$, and $(ABP)$ meets $\\Gamma$ at $A$ and $B$. Thus, $\\angle SPB = \\angle BAK = \\angle BLK$, so lines $SP$ and $KL$ are parallel.\nIt then follows that $\\angle SCP = \\angle SPC = \\angle KDC = \\angle KLC + \\angle LCD$. Since $SC$ is tangent to $\\Gamma$, we see that $\\angle KLC = \\angle SCK$, and thus $\\angle KCD = \\angle LCD = \\angle SCP - \\angle KLC$. Thus since $CM$ bisects $\\angle KCL$ in cyclic quad $CKML$, we have $MK = ML$. $\\blacksquare$\n"

Also, $2(a_4 + a_2) = (a_4 + a_4) + (a_2 + a_2) \\ge (a_4+a_3)+(a_2+a_1) = s_A \\ge 0$, so again $(a_2, a_4)$ isn't a good couple. We have in total 6 couples. So $n_A \\leq 6-2=4$.\nWe now find all sets $A$ with $n_A = 4$. If $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$ are both good couples, and $A=\\{a, b, c, d\\}$, we have $a+b=c+d=s_A/2$.\nSo WLOG $A=\\{a,b,a+x,b-x\\}$ with $x > 0$ and $a < b, b-x, a+x$. It's easy to see $a=a_1$ and since $(a_2, a_4),(a_3,a_4)$ are bad, all couples containing $a$ must be good. Obviously $(a,b)$ and $(a+x,b-x)$ are good ($s_A=2(a+b)$). So we have $2a+x | 2a+2b$ and $a+b-x|2a+2b \\Rightarrow a+b-x|2x$.\nUsing the second equation, we see that if $y=a+b$, $y-x|2x \\Rightarrow yk_1-xk_1=2x \\Rightarrow yk_1 = x(2+k_1) \\Rightarrow y=x((2+k_1)/k_1)$, for some $k_1$ a positive integer. \nSo now we use the first equation to get $2ak_2 + xk_2 = 2y = 2x(2+k_1)/k_1 \\Rightarrow 2ak_2 = x(\\frac{4+2k_1}{k_1}-k_2) \\Rightarrow 2a=x(\\frac{4+2k_1}{k_1k_2} - 1)$, for a natural $k_2$.\nFinally, we obtain $k_1 | 4+2k-1 \\Rightarrow k_1 | 4  \\Rightarrow k_1=$ 1, 2 or 4.

                    "text": "Similarly to the first solution, let us order the terms in set $A$ by $0 < a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < a_4$ since it is given that these four integers must be distinct and positive. Obviously, $s_a > 0$ from this. We know that pair $(a_3, a_4)$ cannot work because $2(a_3 + a_4) > a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = s_A.$ Additionally, pair $(a_2, a_4)$ cannot work for the same reason: $2(a_2 + a_4) = a_4 + a_4 + a_2 + a_2 > s_A.$\nHence, since there were only ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ pairs $(i, j)$ in total, and two pairs are guaranteed not to work, we are to find sets $A$ satisfying $n_A = 6 - 2 = 4.$ Due to our making $a_4$ the largest term of set $A$, the only way to have a pair $(a_i, a_4)$ that exists such that $a_i + a_4 | s_A$ is to make $i$ equal to 1 and find an $a_1$ such that $\\frac{s_A}{a_1 + a_4} = 2.$ When this happens, we know that $\\frac{s_A}{a_2 + a_3} = 2$, as well. It clearly follows that we need pairs $(a_1, a_2)$ and $(a_1, a_3)$ that exist such that both $a_1 + a_2$ and $a_1 + a_3$ divide $s_A.$\nTo satisfy conditions $\\frac{s_A}{a_1 + a_4} = 2$ and $\\frac{s_A}{a_2 + a_3} = 2$, choose a set $A$ with four distinct positive integer elements $a - x, a, b, b + x$ with $0 < a - x < a < b < b + x.$ Obviously, $x < a < b$ for our set to consist solely of positive integers. The problem becomes to find $x, a,$ and $b$ such that $2a - x | 2(a + b)$ and $(a + b) - x | 2a + 2b.$\nWe realize that $x$ can be any positive even integer. This allows $2a - x$ and $2(a + b)$ to have a common factor of 2, simplifying our problem a bit. Hence, $a - \\frac{x}{2}$ must divide $(a + b).$ Now, we can look at the other condition, $(a + b) - x | 2a + 2b$, to solve this problem. To find $a, b, x$ satisfying $(a + b) - x | 2a + 2b$, it suffices to define a positive integer $n$ that makes $n(a + b - x) = 2(a + b) \\Rightarrow 0 = (n - 2)a + (n - 2)b - nx \\Rightarrow (n - 2)(a + b) = nx.$ Note that $x$ must be less than $\\frac{a + b}{2}.$ If $x \\ge \\frac{a + b}{2}$, $(n - 2)(a + b) = nx$ would have solutions $x, a,$ and $b$ that will make $a - x < 0$, since $a < \\frac{a + b}{2}$ due to $a < b.$ This is a contradiction with the condition that each element in set $A$ has to be positive. Despite this, We move on to some cases.\n\n$0 < n \\le 2$ cannot work because this makes at least one of the solutions $a, b, x$ to $(n - 2)(a + b) = nx$ zero or negative, another contradiction.\nFor $n = 3$, we have that $a + b = 3x.$ We need to find possible values for $a$ such that $x < a < \\frac{a + b}{2}$ that satisfy both $a + b = 3x$ and $a - \\frac{x}{2} | (a + b) \\Rightarrow a - \\frac{x}{2} | 3x.$ Note that because $(a + b) = 3$, the sum of our set $A$ is $2(a + b) = 6x.$ Hence, it suffices to call our terms $a -x, a, 3x - a,$ and $4x - a.$ The only values for $a$ and $x$ that work are those such that $5 | a$ and $4 | x$ at the same time, and $11 | a$ and $10 | x$ at the same time. Hence, we get that $a - x = \\frac{a}{5}$ or $\\frac{a}{11}.$ Moreover, it follows that $x = \\frac{4a}{5}$ or $\\frac{10a}{11.}$ On a side note, because we are constrained to $x < a < \\frac{a + b}{2}$, $\\frac{a}{5} = \\frac{x}{4}$ or $\\frac{a}{11} = \\frac{x}{10}$. Note that this completely satisfies $a - \\frac{x}{2} | 3x$ because the $a$ and $x$ that we chose exists such that $4(a - \\frac{x}{2}) = 3x$ for $5 | a$, $4 | x$, and $\\frac{a}{5} = \\frac{x}{4}$.  At the same time, $5(a - \\frac{x}{2}) = 3x$ for $11 | a$, $10 | x$, and  $\\frac{a}{11} = \\frac{x}{10}$. In turn, we have the two sets $A = \\{\\frac{a}{5}, a, \\frac{7a}{5}, \\frac{11a}{5}\\}$ and $\\{\\frac{a}{11}, a, \\frac{19a}{11}, \\frac{29a}{11}\\}.$ Since $a$ must be a multiple of 5 or 11, we can scale these two sets by multiplying by 5 and 11, respectively, to get sets $A = \\{p, 5p, 7p, 11p\\}$ and $\\{p, 11p, 19p, 29p\\}$ with $p$ being any $\\frac{a}{5}$ or $\\frac{a}{11}$ that results in positive integers for the first and second set, respectively. Remember that $a$ cannot be zero because our set must contain positive integers.\n$n \\ge 4$ cannot work because we have established that $x$ cannot be greater than or equal to $\\frac{a + b}{2}.$ Solving the inequality $\\frac{n - 2}{n}(a + b) \\ge \\frac{a + b}{2}$, $a + b$ cancels, resulting in $\\frac{n - 2}{n} \\ge \\frac{1}{2} \\Rightarrow 2n - 4\\ge n \\Rightarrow n \\ge 4.$ This shows that any $n$ greater than or equal to 4 will not work for $x = \\frac{n - 2}{n}(a + b)$ .\nThus, the only possible sets $A$ we have for satisfying the maximum $n_A$, which is 4, are $A = \\{p, 5p, 7p, 11p\\}$ and $\\{p, 11p, 19p, 29p\\}$, with $p$ being any positive integer since it is obvious that any $a$ that is a positive multiple of 5 or 11 makes $\\frac{a}{5}$ and $\\frac{a}{11}$ positive integers, respectively.\n"

It follows, therefore, that the number of ways to place $n$ weights on the balance according to the rule is the same no matter which $n$ distinct powers of two are the weights, as each weight completely overpowers any smaller weight and is completely overpowered by any larger weight. That is, there is the 1st heaviest weight, the 2nd heaviest, the 3rd, ..., the n-th heaviest, and each weight is negligible compared to any heavier weight. Thus, any valid placement of $n$ weights of weight $2^0,2^1, \\cdots ,2^{n-1}$ can changed by replacing $2^i$ with the $(n-i)$-th heaviest weight in the set ${2^{a_k}}$, where $a_k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, and vice versa, forming a $1:1$ relation.

Suppose that, for any two integers $m$ and $n$, the difference $f(m) - f(n)$ is divisible by $f(m - n)$. Prove that, for all integers $m$ and $n$ with $f(m) \\leq f(n)$, the number $f(n)$ is divisible by $f(m)$.\n**Solution 2**\nWe first note the following facts:\n$f(m)|f(0)$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:  Since $f(m) |( f(m) - f(0))$.\n$f(m) = f(-m)$ for all $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$: Since $f(m) | (f(0) - f(-m))$, we get $f(m) | f(-m)$ from above.  This holds for all $m$, so $f(m) = f(-m)$ for all $m$.\n$f(m)|f(km)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.  Because of the the above observations, we need to show this only for $k > 0$.  When $k = 1$, this is clearly true.  We now use induction, along with the observation that $f(m)|(f((k+1)m) - f(km))$, so that $f(m)|f(km) \\implies f(m)|f((k+1)m)$.\nIf $f(a) | f(ax + b)$, then $f(a) | f(b)$.  We have from the hypotheses that $f(ax)|(f(ax+b)-f(b))$ which implies that $f(a)|(f(ax + b) - f(b))$ and therefore $f(a) | f(b)$ (here we used the last observation).\nFrom the first three observations, we get the following lemma:\n**Lemma 1**:  Suppose $m \\neq n$, and $f(m) \\leq f(n)$.  If $|n-m|$ divides $n$, then $f(m) | f(n)$.  \n**Proof**: Let $d = |n-m|$. Using the second observation above, we get that \\[f(n)|(f(d) - f(m)).\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;(1)\\]  Now, since $d|n$, we get that $f(d) | f(n)$ (from the third observation above), and hence $f(d) \\leq f(n)$.  Since $f(m) \\leq f(n)$ as well, and the range of $f$ is positive integers, equation (1) can hold only if $f(m) = f(d)$.  But $f(d) | f(n)$, so $f(m) | f(n)$, as required.\n\nWe can now complete the proof.  Notice that because of the first and\nsecond observations above, we can assume without loss of generality\nthat $m, n > 0$.  So, let $m,n$ be positive integers, and let $g = {\\rm gcd (n, m)}$.  We now show that if $f(m) \\leq f(n)$ then\n$f(m)|f(g)$, and hence $f(m) | f(n)$.\nBy the Euclidean algorithm, there exist positive\nintegers $x$ and $y$ such that $mx = ny + g$.  Notice that $g = mx - ny$ divides both $mx$ and $ny$.   We now have two cases:\n\nCase 1: $f(mx) \\leq f(ny)$. In this case, by Lemma 1, $f(mx) | f(ny)$, and hence by the third and fourth observations above, $f(m) | f(mx - g)$ which implies that $f(m) | f(g)$.   This immediately implies $f(m) | f(n)$ by the third observation above, since $g | n$.\nCase 2: $f(mx) > f(ny)$. In this case, by Lemma 1, $f(ny) | f(mx)$, and hence by the third and fourth observations above $f(n) | f(g)$.  However, $g$ divides both $m$ and $n$, so by the third observation above, we get that $f(g)|f(n)$ and $f(g)|f(m)$.  Thus, using the fact that $f(m) \\leq f(n)$, we get $f(g) = f(m) = g(n)$ and hence $f(m) | f(n)$.\n--Mahamaya 20:05, 21 May 2012 (EDT)\n"

In other words, if A indicates on the $m^{th}$ step that $x$ was in a set containing $i$, then $f(i,m)=0$, while if A indicates otherwise, we would have $f(i,m)=f(i,m-1)+1$.\nAt the $m^{th}$ step, player A makes a decision so as to minimize the sum: \\[g(m)=\\sum_{i=1}^N 1.999^{f(i,m)}\\] I claim that, by using this strategy, A will preserve the invariant that $g(m) < 1.999^{k+1}$. We can prove this by induction on $m$.\nNote that initially, $g(0)=N<1.999^{k+1}$.\nSuppose that $g(m-1) < 1.999^{k+1}$.

Hence, $\\angle{XTY} = \\angle{XTW} + \\angle{YTW} = 180^\\circ$, so $XTY$ is a straight line.\nLemma 2: $T$ is on $AW$.\nProof: Let the circumcircles of $NBW$ and $MWC$ be $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$, respectively, and, as $BNMC$ is cyclic (from congruent $\\angle{BNC} = \\angle{BMC} = 90^\\circ$), let its circumcircle be $\\omega_3$. Then each pair of circles' radical axises, $BN, TW,$ and $MC$, must concur at the intersection of $BN$ and $MC$, which is $A$.\nLemma 3: $YT$ is perpendicular to $AW$.\nProof: This is immediate from $\\angle{YTW} = 90^\\circ$.\nLet $AH$ meet $BC$ at $L$, which is also the foot of the altitude to that side. Hence, $\\angle{ALB} = 90^\\circ.$\nLemma 4: Quadrilateral $THLW$ is cyclic.\nProof: We know that $NHLB$ is cyclic because $\\angle{BNH}$ and $\\angle{BLH}$, opposite and right angles, sum to $180^\\circ$. Furthermore, we are given that $NTWB$ is cyclic. Hence, by Power of a Point,\n\\[AT * AW = AN * AB = AH * AL.\\]\nThe converse of Power of a Point then proves $THLW$ cyclic.\nHence, $\\angle{WTH} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{WLH} = 90^\\circ$, and so $HT$ is perpendicular to $AW$ as well. Combining this with Lemma 3's statement, we deduce that $T, H, Y$ are collinear. But, as $X$ is on $YT$ (from Lemma 1), $X, Y, H$ are collinear.

Notice that $\\lceil n\\rceil  < n + 1$.\nFirst, we shall show that each $n \\times n$ chessboard with a peaceful configuration of $n$ rooks contains a valid $k \\times k$ square. Consider firstly the rook $R$ on the top row of the board. Because $k < n$, there exists a set $C$ of $k$ consecutive columns, one of which contains rook $R$. Consider the $n - k + 1$ $k \\times k$ squares in $C$. Of them, only one contains the rook $R$ on one of its squares. Furthermore, each of the other $k - 1$ rooks in $C$ can only make up to $k$ of the $k \\times k$ squares have it on one of its squares. Therefore, because\n\\[n - k + 1 = n - \\lceil \\sqrt{n}\\rceil  + 2 > n - \\sqrt{n} + 1 = \\sqrt{n} (\\sqrt{n} - 1) + 1 > (\\lceil \\sqrt{n}\\rceil  - 1) (\\lceil \\sqrt{n}\\rceil  - 2) + 1 = k(k - 1) + 1,\\]\nby the Pigeonhole Principle there exists a $k \\times k$ square in $C$ not covered by any rook in $C$. Clearly, that square cannot be covered by any rook outside of $C$, and so it is a valid choice.\nIt remains to show that there exists a chessboard without a $(k+1) \\times (k+1)$ square. Indeed, such a board exists. First, place a rook at the upper-left corner of the board. Next, place a rook 1 space to the right and $(k+1)$ spaces down of the first rook. Then, place a rook 1 space to the right and $(k+1)$ spaces down of the second rook, and so on, until the placement of a new rook will be under the lower boundary of the board. In that case, place a rook in the same unoccupied column and in the first unoccupied row, and continue placement of subsequent rooks. This arrangement of rooks is clearly peaceful, and because $(k+1)^2 > n$ it has the property that any $(k+1) \\times (k+1)$ square in the board will be occupied by at least one rook, completing the proof.\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

In other words, we are trying to prove $\\angle {BDC} + \\angle {BAC} = 180$. \nLet the intersection of $BM$ and $AN$ be point $E$, and the intersection of $AM$ and $CN$ be point $F$. \nLet us assume $\\angle {BDC} + \\angle {BAC} = 180$. Note: This is circular reasoning. If $\\angle {BDC} + \\angle {BAC} = 180$, then $\\angle {BAC}$ should be equal to $\\angle {BDN}$ and $\\angle {CDM}$. We can quickly prove that the triangles $ABC$, $APB$, and $AQC$ are similar, so $\\angle {BAC} = \\angle {AQC} = \\angle {APB}$. We also see that $\\angle {AQC} = \\angle {BQN} = \\angle {APB} = \\angle {CPF}$. Also because angles $BEQ$ and $NED, MFD$ and $CFP$ are equal, the triangles $BEQ$ and $NED$, $MDF$ and $FCP$ must be two pairs of similar triangles. Therefore we must prove angles $CBM$ and $ANC, AMB$ and $BCN$ are equal. \nWe have angles $BQA = APC = NQC = BPM$. We also have $AQ = QN$, $AP = PM$. Because the triangles $ABP$ and $ACQ$ are similar, we have $\\dfrac {EC}{EN} = \\dfrac {BF}{FM}$, so triangles $BFM$ and $NEC$ are similar. So the angles $CBM$ and $ANC, BCN$ and $AMB$ are equal and we are done.\n### Solution 2\nLet $L$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Easy angle chasing gives $\\angle{AQP} = \\angle{APQ} = \\angle{BAC}$. Because $P$ is the midpoint of $AM$, the cotangent rule applied on triangle $MBA$ gives us\n\\[\\cot \\angle{MBC} - \\cot \\angle{ABC} = 2\\cot \\angle{BAC}.\\]\nHence, by the cotangent rule on $ABC$, we have\n\\[\\cot \\angle{BAL} = 2\\cot \\angle{BAC} + \\cot \\angle{ABC} = \\cot \\angle{MBC}.\\]\nBecause the period of cotangent is $180^\\circ$, but angles are less than $180^\\circ$, we have $\\angle{BAL} = \\angle{MBC}.$\nSimilarly, we have $\\angle{LAC} = \\angle{NCB}.$ Hence, if $BM$ and $CN$ intersect at $Z$, then $\\angle{BZC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{BAC}$ by the Angle Sum in a Triangle Theorem. Hence, $BACZ$ is cyclic, which is equivalent to the desired result.\n--[Suli](/wiki/index.php?title=User:Suli&action=edit&redlink=1) 23:27, 7 February 2015 (EST)\n### Solution 3\nLet $L$ be the midpoint of $BC$. By AA Similarity, triangles $BAP$ and $BCA$ are similar, so $\\dfrac{BA}{AP} = \\dfrac{BC}{CA}$ and $\\angle{BPA} = \\angle{BAC}$. Similarly, $\\angle{CQA} = \\angle{BAC}$, and so triangle $AQP$ is isosceles. Thus, $AQ = AP$, and so $\\dfrac{BA}{AQ} = \\dfrac{BC}{CA}$. Dividing both sides by 2, we have $\\dfrac{BA}{AN} = \\dfrac{BL}{AC}$, or\n\\[\\frac{BA}{BL} = \\frac{AN}{AC}.\\]\nBut we also have $\\angle{ABL} = \\angle{CAQ}$, so triangles $ABL$ and $NAC$ are similar by $SAS$ similarity. In particular, $\\angle{ANC} = \\angle{BAL}$. Similarly, $\\angle{BMA} = \\angle{CAL}$, so $\\angle{ANC} + \\angle{BMA} = \\angle{BAC}$. In addition, angle sum in triangle $AQP$ gives $\\angle{QAP} = 180^\\circ - 2\\angle{A}$. Therefore, if we let lines $BM$ and $CN$ intersect at $T$, by Angle Sum in quadrilateral $AMTN$ concave $\\angle{NTM} = 180^\\circ + \\angle{A}$, and so convex $\\angle{BTC} = 180^\\circ - \\angle{A}$, which is enough to prove that $BACT$ is cyclic.

Similarly, we can find $ABD_2C$ is harmonic. Therefore, $D_1=D_2,$ which means that $BM$ and $CN$ intersect on the circumcircle. $\\blacksquare$\n### Solution 5\nWe use barycentric coordinates. Due to the equal angles, $AC$ is tangent to the circumcircle of $ABQ$ and $AB$ is tangent to the circumcircle of the $APC.$ Therefore, we can use power of a point to solve for side ratios. We have \\[A=(1,0,0), B=(0,1,0), C=(0,0,1)\\] \\[P=(0:a^2-c^2:c^2),Q=(0:b^2:a^2-b^2)\\] \\[M=(-a^2:2a^2-2c^2:2c^2),N=(-a^2:2b^2:2a^2-2b^2)\\]\nTherefore, $D=(-a^2:2b^2:2c^2),$ as $BM$ and $CN$ are cevians. Note that $(x,y,z)$ lies on the circumcircle iff $a^2yz+b^2xz+c^2xy=0.$ Substituting the values in, we have \\[-4a^2b^2c^2+2a^2b^2c^2+2a^2b^2c^2=0,\\] so we are done. $\\blacksquare$\n### Solution 6\nNote that the givens immediately imply that $\\triangle{ABC} \\sim \\triangle{QAC} \\sim \\triangle{PBA}$, hence $\\angle{AQP}=\\angle{APQ}=\\angle{A}$. Let $D$ be the midpoint of BC, $E$ be the midpoint of $AC$, and $F$ the midpoint of $AB$. By the similar triangles, we have $\\angle{BAD}=\\angle{AQE}=\\angle{AMC}$. We also have $\\angle{BAD}=\\angle{BPF}=\\angle{MNB}$, so we find $\\angle{AMC}=\\angle{MNB}$. We note that $\\angle{AMC}+\\angle{CMN}=\\angle{AMN}=\\angle{AQP}=\\angle{A}$, so $\\angle{CMN}+\\angle{MNB}=A$, which gives that $\\angle{BKC}=180-\\angle{A}$ and we are done.\nAs an addition, $AK$ is the A-symmedian in $\\triangle{ABC}$.\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Then each line will have $n-1$ points. We call 2 points (on a line) neighbors if there are no other points on the line segment joining those 2. Then each finite region has to be a convex polygon whose any pair of neighboring vertices are, well, neighbors. Now start by coloring any line blue, and all points are uncolored (neither red nor blue).\nSuppose there is an uncolored line which does not pass through any red points. Color that line blue. Now consider each of the intersections that line makes with the other blue lines. For each intersection point $X$ of the 2 blue lines $l_1,l_2$, color it blue (it was originally uncolored). Now consider the neighbors of $X$ on $l_1,l_2$, call them $A_1,A_2$ on $l_1$ and $B_1,B_2$ on $l_2$ (if there is only 1 neighbor, let the other point be an uncolored dummy). If neither $A_1$ nor $A_2$ is blue, we colour them both red. Else if neither $B_1$ nor $B_2$ is blue, we colour them both red. Otherwise, we colour the uncolored ones (out of the 4 points) red. Anyway, we would have colored at most 2 points red. Once we have done this for all the intersection points, proceed back to the start of this paragraph until no such line exists.\nNow to show it works. Suppose there is a finite region polygon $P_1...P_m$ with all blue boundaries (with $P_{m+1}=P_1$). Then all the points must be blue. Consider the first point colored blue, WLOG let it be $P_2$. Suppose the previous line to be colored blue is $P_1P_2$. Then $P_2P_3$ has to be colored blue before that, and $P_3P_4$ has to be uncolored (otherwise $P_3$ will be colored blue first). So $P_3$ is uncolored. Then if $P_1$ is blue, $P_3$ will be colored red by our coloring algorithm. $P_1$ has to be uncolored and by our coloring algorithm at least one of $P_1,P_3$ will be colored red. Note that no blue line will pass through a red point. Thus there are no finite region with blue boundaries.\nNow suppose $k$ lines are blue. By our algorithm, each blue point intersection will introduce at most 2 red points. Since we can't color any more lines blue, those red points will cover the remaining lines. Thus $2\\binom{k}{2}\\geq n-k\\implies k\\geq \\sqrt{n}$ exact.\nNote: this works for all ${n}\\geq{2}$, provided there is no mistake.\n"

The sequence is represented on it by the subset $\\{(i,a_i) \\mid i \\in \\mathbb N\\}$ which is painted red. Each line $L_n$ of kind $x+y=n$, where $n \\ge 2$ is an integer, will be called a carrier line. Note that the condition (ii) states that each carrier line is occupied by at most one red point. Every such line with exactly one red point on it will be called occupied while the rest carriers will be called free.\nFirst we prove that the set of free carriers is finite. Indeed, all the carriers $L_n$ with $2 \\le n \\le T+m+1$, where $m \\in \\mathbb N$, cover the part of the base strip having $x \\le m$, so there are at least $m$ red points lying on them. Thus, the number of free carriers among them is at most $T+m-m=T$. Since $m$ is arbitrary, the total number of free cariers doesn't exceed $T$. Take $N$ such that all the carriers $L_n$ with $n \\ge N+2$ are occupied.\nNext, take any red point and consider the points on the base strip which are lying on the point's carrier below it (i.e. having strictly greater $x$). Call it the point's trace and paint black. Finally, the set $P_x=\\{\\,y \\mid (x,y) \\text { is black}\\}$ will be called a pattern, the number elements $|P_x|$ in it will be called its volume and the sum $w_x$ of all elements in $P_x$ will be called its weight.\nNow let $j>N$. Lets track how $P_j$, its volume and its weight change when $j$ increases by 1. Obviously $P_{j+1}$ is $P_j$ plus added $a_j$ (red point) and shifted down by $1$; a point that goes to $0$ vanishes. This means that the volume doesn't change at all. Indeed, if $1 \\notin P_j$, then $a_j=1$ or the carrier $L_{j+1}$ will remain unoccupied, so one point always vanishes going to $0$, and exactly one point is added before the shift (it may be the same point). Let $v$ be this constant volume. As a pattern never contains $T+1$, $v$ ranges from $0$ to $T$. Now it is clearly that $w_{j+1}$ is $w_j$ plus $a_j$ (red point added) and minus $v+1$ (all elements are shifted by $1$), i.e. $a_j-(v+1)=w_{j+1}-w_j$. Thus, when $n>m\\ge N$: \\[\\sum_{j=m+1}^n(a_j-(v+1))=w_{n+1}-w_{m+1}\\,.\\]To finish, it remains to note that the weight ranges from $1+2+\\dots+v$ to $(T-v+1)+(T-v+2)+\\dots+T$, so its swing is:\\[\\sum_{i=1}^v (T-v+i) - \\sum_{i=1}^v i=\\sum_{i=1}^v (T-v)=(T-v)\\,v\\;. \\quad \\blacksquare\\]\n"

Select an arbitrary point H along the segment BC', and from point H select an arbitrary point F such that the segment HF is perpendicular to the segment AB. Mark the distance from the intersection of HF and AB to B at B\" (i.e., HF is a perpendicular bisector). It follows that the triangle B\"FB is isosceles. Construct an isosceles triangle FHG. Mark the distance of AB\" along AC' at C\". (From here, a circle can be constructed according to the sets of points A, B, F, and A, B, G. Points F and G may be repositioned to allow for these circles to coincide; also, point H may be repositioned so that point C falls on the coinciding circle, understood that HG is the other perpendicular bisector.) \nAssign the angle BAC the value \u03b1. Hence, the angle FHG has the value 180\u00b0-\u03b1, and the angle HFG (also, HGF) has the value \u03b1/2. Assign the angle BFH the value \u03b2. Hence, the angle B'FB\" has the value  \u03b2-\u03b1/2. Consequently, the angle FB'B\" has the value 180\u00b0-(\u03b2-\u03b1/2)-(90\u00b0-\u03b2) =  90\u00b0+\u03b1/2, and so too its vertical angle BB'G. As the triangle B\"AC\" is isosceles, and its subtended angle has the value \u03b1, the angles BB\"C\" and CC\"B\" both have the value 90\u00b0+\u03b1/2.

Define $E_{n-1} = E[L(C)]$ here. Now, for $n$ coins, define $E_{n} = E[L{C}]$ across all $2^n$ configurations. Consider cases on the last coin:\nCase 1: Final coin is $T$\nIf the last coin is $T$, then we simply can forget about it, as we can flip it to heads only if we have n heads, which is impossible. This occurs with probablity $P_{T} = 1/2$, and will be identical to the general $n-1$ case; thus, this process terminates, and we will have an expected number of moves here of $E_{n-1}$. \nCase 2: Final coin is $H$\nThe probability that this occurs is $P_{H} = 1/2$. The only way we have for the process to terminate now is for all coins to show heads, after which we can progressively flip each coin from right to left (this will take $n$ moves). Thus, we now have a new goal for the first $n-1$ coins (given the head at the end); get all heads.\nWe claim that this process is symmetrical to the original process on $n-1$ coins, and thus it terminates and has the expected number of moves $E_{n-1}$.\nProof: Let us have $k \\ge 1$ heads in our group of n coins, of which $k-1$ are in the first n-1. We are supposed to flip the $k$'th coin from the left in the first n-1 coins, which is equivalent to flipping the $(n-k)$'th coin from the right (in the first $n-1$ coins, NOT all $n$ coins), but there are $n-k$ tails in the first $n-1$ coins! We now have a new process defined as follows:\nConsider a configuration of $n-1$ coins with $x \\ge 1$ tails, and flip the x'th coin from the right, and keep flipping until all coins are heads. \nThis is clearly symmetric to the original process, and will terminate if and only if the original process on $n-1$ coins does, and has the same expected number of moves as the original. Thus, the claim is proven.\nBack to the case: We now have a process to get to all heads that will terminate with an expected number of steps of $E_{n-1}$, and then an n-step algorithm to reach the finish. Thus, here also, the process terminates, and we have a total expected number of steps as $E_{n-1}+n$.\nThus, the overall process on n coins will terminate, since the process terminates in both the representative cases on n-1 coins. $\\boxed{Q.E.D}$ Also, the expected value of steps can be easily computed now; $E_{n} = (P_{T})(E_{n-1})+(P_{H})(E_{n-1}+n) = E_{n-1}+n/2 = \\frac{n(n-1}{4}+\\frac{n}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}}$ as desired. We are now done.\n-Solution by thanosaops\n### Solution 2 (Strong Induction and Alternative Case Division)\nWe define a sequence $\\{a_i\\}_{i=1}^n$: $a_i=1$ if the $i$'th coin is $H$ and $a_i=0$ if the $i$'th coin is $T$. Then, $k$ will be the number of $1$'s in $\\{a_i\\}$ and after each operation, $a_k$ will be changed to $1-a_k$. Let $f(n)=\\sum L\\{a_i\\}=$ sum of $L\\{a_i\\}$ over all possible $\\{a_i\\}$ (of length $n$).\nWe shall prove that the process terminates and find the value of $f(n)$ using strong induction.\n\nBase case: Clearly, for $n=1$, the process terminates.\nInduction hypothesis: For $n=1, 2, 3, \\cdots, k$, the process terminates.\nInductive step: We claim that for $n=k+1$, the process terminates as well.\n\nCase 1: $a_1=1$\nThis means that $\\{a_i\\}=\\{1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_n\\}$. With the proof of the claim in Solution 1, we can similarly prove that operating on $\\{a_i\\}$ is equivalent to operating on $\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_n\\}$.\nBy our induction hypothesis, this process will terminate, and hence $\\{a_i\\}$ will be changed to $\\{1, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0\\}$ at the end of this process. Now, we operate one more time to change $a_1$ from $1$ to $0$. Hence, the process terminates.\nWe can also see that $L\\{a_i\\}=L\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_n\\}+1$. Hence, sum of $L\\{a_i\\}$ over all possible $\\{a_i\\}$ in this case \\[=\\sum L\\{a_i\\}=\\sum \\left[L\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_n\\}+1\\right]=f(n-1)+2^{n-1}\\]\n\nCase 2: $a_1=0$ and $a_n=1$\nThis means that $\\{a_i\\}=\\{0, a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}, 1\\}$. Operating on $\\{a_i\\}$ is now equivalent to operating on $\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}$.\nBy our induction hypothesis, this process will terminate, and hence $\\{a_i\\}$ will be changed to $\\{0, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0, 1\\}$ at the end of this process. Now, since $k=1$, $a_1$ will become $1$. Now, $k=2$, so $a_2$ will become $1$ as well. This process will repeat until $k=n$ and $\\{a_i\\}$ has been changed to $\\{1, 1, 1, \\cdots, 1\\}$. Now, since $k=n$, $a_n$ will become $0$. Now, $k=n-1$, so $a_{n-1}$ will become $0$ as well. This process will repeat again until $k=0$ and $\\{a_i\\}$ has been changed to $\\{0, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0\\}$. Hence, the process terminates.\nWe can also see that $L\\{a_i\\}=L\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}+(2n-1)$. Hence, sum of $L\\{a_i\\}$ over all possible $\\{a_i\\}$ in this case \\[=\\sum L\\{a_i\\}=\\sum \\left[L\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}+(2n-1)\\right]=f(n-2)+2^{n-2}\\cdot(2n-1)\\]\n\nCase 3: $a_n=0$\nThis means that $\\{a_i\\}=\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}, 0\\}$. Operating on $\\{a_i\\}$ is now equivalent to operating on $\\{a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}$.\nBy our induction hypothesis, this process will terminate, and hence $\\{a_i\\}$ will be changed to $\\{0, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0, 0\\}$ at the end of this process. Hence, the process terminates.\nWe can also see that $L\\{a_i\\}=L\\{a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}$. Hence, sum of $L\\{a_i\\}$ over all possible $\\{a_i\\}$ in this case \\[=\\sum L\\{a_i\\}=\\sum \\left[L\\{a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}\\right]=f(n-1)\\]\n\nThis is already sufficient to prove part A, but we want to find $f(n)$ too, and we have overcounted!\nCase 4: $a_1=1$ and $a_n=0$ (This is what we have overcounted)\nThis means that $\\{a_i\\}=\\{1, a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}, 0\\}$. Operating on $\\{a_i\\}$ is now equivalent to operating on $\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}$.\nBy our induction hypothesis, this process will terminate, and hence $\\{a_i\\}$ will be changed to $\\{1, 0, 0, \\cdots, 0, 0\\}$ at the end of this process. Now, we operate one more time to change $a_1$ from $1$ to $0$. Hence, the process terminates.\nWe can also see that $L\\{a_i\\}=L\\{a_2, a_3, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}+1$. Hence, sum of $L\\{a_i\\}$ over all possible $\\{a_i\\}$ in this case \\[=\\sum L\\{a_i\\}=\\sum \\left[L\\{a_1, a_2, \\cdots, a_{n-1}\\}+1\\right]=f(n-2)+2^{n-2}\\]\n\nHence, we have proven that for all configurations, the process terminates, $\\boxed{Q.E.D.}$ Now, all that remains is to calculate $f(n)$.\n\\begin{align*} f(n) &= f(n-1)+2^{n-1}+f(n-2)+2^{n-2}\\cdot(2n-1)+f(n-1)-\\left[f(n-2)+2^{n-2}\\right] \\\\ &= 2f(n-1)+2^{n-1}\\cdot n \\end{align*}\nThis can be rearranged to give us\n\\[f(n)-n(n+1)\\cdot2^{n-2}=2\\left[f(n-1)-n(n-1)\\cdot2^{n-3}\\right]\\]\nWhen $n=1$, $f(n)-n(n+1)\\cdot2^{n-2}=0$. This is good, because now we know that $\\forall n\\in\\mathbb{Z}^{+}, f(n)-n(n+1)\\cdot2^{n-2}=0$ i.e. $f(n)=n(n+1)\\cdot2^{n-2}$.\nNow the average will be $\\frac{n(n+1)\\cdot2^{n-2}}{2^n}=\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}n(n+1)}$\n~[IraeVid13](/wiki/index.php/User:Iraevid13)\n"

Let $H$ be the region sandwiched by $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$. It is easy to show that both the area and the perimeter of $H\\cap D$ is bounded by $O(\\sqrt{r})$ (since $r=\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$). Hence, there can only be $O(\\sqrt{r})=O(n^{1/3})$ points in $H\\cap S$, by that any two points in $S$ are distance $1$ apart. Since the width of $H$ is $1$, there must exist a line $\\ell$ parallel to $\\ell_1$ such that $\\ell$ separates $S$, and any point in $S$ is at least $1/O(n^{1/3}) = \\Omega(n^{-1/3})$ away from $\\ell$.  Q.E.D.\nNote. One can also show that $\\Omega(n^{-1/3})$ is best possible.\n"

Assume the perfect squares $p^2$, $q^2$, and $r^2$ satisfy the following system of equations: \n\\usepackage{amsmath} \\begin{align*} a+b &= p^2 \\\\ b+c &= q^2 \\\\ a+c &= r^2 \\end{align*}\nwhere $a$, $b$, and $c$ are numbers on three of the cards. Solving for $a$, $b$, and $c$ in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$ tells us that $a = \\frac{p^2 + r^2 - q^2}{2}$, $b=\\frac{p^2 + q^2 - r^2}{2}$, and $c=\\frac{q^2 + r^2 - p^2}{2}$. We can then substitute $p^2 = (2e-1)^2$, $q^2 = (2e)^2$, and $r^2 = (2e+1)^2$ to cancel out the $2$s in the denominatior, and simplifying gives $a = 2e^2 + 1$, $b = 2e(e-2)$, and $c = 2e(e+2)$. Now, we have to prove that there exists three numbers in these forms between $n$ and $2n$ when $n \\ge 100$. Notice that $b$ will always be the least of the three and $c$ will always be the greatest of the three. So it is sufficient to prove that there exists numbers in the form $2e(e-2)$ and $2e(e+2)$ between $n$ and $2n$. \n\nFor two numbers in the form of $2e(e-2)$ and $2e(e+2)$ to be between $n$ and $2n$, the inequalities\n\\usepackage{amsmath} \\begin{align*} 2e(e-2) &\\ge n \\\\ 2e(e+2) &\\le 2n \\\\ \\end{align*}\nmust be satisfied. We can then expand and simplify to get that\n\\usepackage{amsmath} \\begin{align*} e^2 - 2e - \\frac{n}{2} &\\ge 0 \\\\ e^2 + 2e - n &\\le 0. \\\\ \\end{align*}\nThen, we can complete the square on the left sides of both inequalities and isolate $e$ to get that\n\\usepackage{amsmath} \\begin{align*} e &\\ge \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{n}{2}} + 1 \\\\ e &\\le \\sqrt{1 + n} - 1 \\\\ \\end{align*}\nNotice that $e$ must be an integer, so there must be an integer between $\\sqrt{1 + n} - 1$ and $\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{n}{2}} + 1$. If $\\sqrt{1 + n} - 1$ and $\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{n}{2}} + 1$ differ by at least $1$, then we can guarantee that there is an integer between them (and those integers are the possible values of $e$). Setting up the inequality $\\sqrt{1 + n} - \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{n}{2}} - 2 \\ge 1$ and solving for $n$ tells us that $n \\in [107, \\infty)$ always works. Testing the remaining $7$ numbers ($100$ to $106$) manually tells us that there is an integer between $\\sqrt{1 + n} - 1$ and $\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{n}{2}} + 1$ when $n \\ge 100$. Therefore, there exists a triplet of integers $(a,b,c)$ with $a, b, c \\in \\{n, n+1, ..., 2n\\}$ when $n \\ge 100$ such that every pair of the numbers sum to a perfect square. By the pigeonhole principle, we know that $2$ of the numbers must be on cards in the same pile, and hence, when $n \\ge 100$, there will always be a pile with $2$ numbers that sum to a perfect square. $\\square$\n~Mathdreams\n"

The index $i$ in $H_i$ is considered modulo $2021$\nLet the nuts be denoted by $N_1, N_2, \\dots, N_{2021}$ and define $N_i < N_j$ when $i < j$.\nLet a nut $n$ in hole $H_i$ be a good nut if the two neighboring nuts $a, b$ in holes $H_{i-1}$ and $H_{i+1}$ satisfy either $a,b < n$ or $n < a,b$. A nut $n$ is a bad nut if it is not good. When good or bad is used for a hole, it refers to the nut in the hole.\nThe status of a nut is wether it is good or bad.\nTwo adjacent nuts $a,b$ in holes $H_i$ and $H_{i+1}$ respectively are an increasing pair if $a < b$ and a decreasing pair if $a > b$.\nJust before the $k$'th move we denote all nuts $N_i$ with $i\\geq k$ to be upcomming nuts.\nDuring move $k$, $N_k$ is the current nut.The proof works by counting the parity of upcomming bad nuts and hinges on the fact that 2021 is odd.\nWe start by proving that at any point in time there are an odd number of bad\nnuts. Let $B$ be the number of bad nuts and $G$ the number of good nuts. A bad\nnut is either part of two increasing or two decreasing pairs. Let the number\nof increasing bad nuts be $B_1$ and decreasing bad nuts be $B_2$. A good nut\nis part of one increasing and one decreasing pair. Let $I$ and $D$ be the\nnumber of increasing and decreasing pairs respectively. Then\n$2I = G + 2B_1$\n$2D = G + 2B_2$\nsince we are double-counting each pair. Therefore $G$ must be even, and since $2021 = G + B$ is odd, $B$ must be odd.\nIf we can prove the existence of a bad current nut, we are done. We show that when a current nut is good, the number of bad upcomming nuts does not change parity after the move. Since there are and odd number of upcomming bad nuts before the first move (every nut is upcomming) and 0 upcomming bad nuts after the last move (there are 0 upcomming nuts), this will show not all current nuts can be good which completes the proof.\nWe now show that when the current nut is good, the number of bad upcomming nots does not change parity. Consider the $k$'th move and assume the current $n$ is good and lies in hole $H_i$. After the move, the current nut is no longer upcomming, but since it was asummed to be good, this does not contrubute to the number of bad upcomming nuts. The only nuts whose status can possibly change is the nuts in holes $H_{i-2}, H_{i-1}, H_{i+1}, H_{i+2}$. Since the current nut is good, its two neighbors $a,b$ in $H_{i-1}, H_{i+1}$ respectively are either both smaller or larger than $n$. We tackle the two cases seperately.\n\n**None**\nIn this case neither $a$ nor $b$ are upcomming nuts at the time of the move and their status after the move is \nirrelevant for the parity of bad upcomming nuts. Consider the nut $c$ in hole $H_{i-2}$. If $c$ is not upcomming, it is irrelevant. Assume $c$ is upcomming. Then $c > n$ and thus $c > a,b$. Therefore the nut pair $H_{i-2}, H_{i-1}$ is decreasing both before and after the move, so $c$ cannot change status. One can make an analogous argument for the nut on $H_{i+2}$. This completes the proof the the parity of upcomming bad nuts are unchanged in this case.\n\n**None**\nIn this case the nuts $a,b$ are upcomming, so their status matters. Let $c$ be the nut in $H_{i-2}$. If the status of either of the holes $H_{i-2}, H_{i-1}$ change, it changes for both of them. This is because the pair $H_{i-1}, H_i$ is decreasing both before and after the move, so for a status change to occur it must be the case that it is the pair $H_{i-2}, H_{i-1}$ which changes direction (which in turn changes the status for both holes). If swapping $a$ and $b$ changes the direction of $H_{i-2}, H_{i-1}$, then either $a < c < b$ or $b < c < a$ is true. In both cases, $c > n$, so $c$ is an upcomming nut. Since the nuts in both $H_{i-1}$ and $H_{i+1}$ are upcomming both before and after the move, changing the status of either $H_{i-2}$ or $H_{i-1}$ yields a status change for two upcomming nuts. A completely analogous argument can be made for $H_{i+1}, H_{i+2}$.\nThis shows that if some upcomming nut changes status after the move, then an even number of upcomming nuts change status. This preserves the parity of the number of upcomming bad nuts and completes the proof.\n"

This function clearly satisfies the required property since the expression \\( xf(y) + yf(x) = \\frac{x}{y} + \\frac{y}{x} \\) is greater than 2 for every \\( y \\neq x \\) (directly from AM-GM) and equal to 2 (with equality) for the unique value \\( y = x \\).\nProof: Let's consider a solution based on some ideas we encountered in the preparation classes for the Olympiad, specifically involving auxiliary sets and functions with specific properties.\nThe fact that for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\), there exists a unique \\( y \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) that satisfies the equation \\( xf(y) + yf(x) \\leq 2 \\) can be equivalently expressed as follows: there exists a well-defined function \\( g: \\mathbb{R}^+ \\to \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) given by \\( g(x)\u00a0:= y \\), where \\( y \\) is the one mentioned above. The well-definedness of this function is evident due to the existence and uniqueness, and it satisfies the equation \\( P(x): \\quad xf(g(x)) + f(x)g(x) \\leq 2 \\) while applying the same property for \\( x \\mapsto g(x) \\) gives another unique \\( y\u00a0:= g(g(x)) \\) such that \\( g(x)f(y) + yf(g(x)) \\leq 2 \\). Therefore, we have \\( xf(y) + yf(x) > 2 \\) for all \\( y \\neq g(x) \\).\nSince this inequality holds for \\( y = x \\) (from \\( xf(y) + yf(x) > 2 \\)), the uniqueness assumption implies that \\( g(g(x)) = x \\), making \\( g \\) an involution (hence bijective).\nGenerally, working with an involution naturally leads us to consider its fixed points, especially since we aim to show that \\( g(x) = x \\) identically (which holds for the solution \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x}\\)). Let's define the set of fixed points of \\( g \\) as \\( \\mathcal{S}\u00a0:= \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\mid g(x) = x \\} \\) and show that \\( \\mathcal{S} = \\mathbb{R}^+ \\) is the entire domain.\nAssume for a contradiction that some \\( x \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) is not a fixed point, i.e., \\( x \\neq g(x) \\). Then, the inequality \\( 2xf(x) > 2 \\) (derived from \\( y \\mapsto x \\)) holds, implying \\( f(x) > \\frac{1}{x} \\). Similarly, \\( x \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) implies \\( g(x) \\notin \\mathcal{S} \\) (otherwise \\( g(x) \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) implies \\( x = g(g(x)) = g(x) \\), a contradiction), leading to \\( f(g(x)) > \\frac{1}{g(x)} \\).\nApplying these inequalities to \\( P(x) \\) gives \\( xf(g(x)) + f(x)g(x) < 2 \\), which is clearly a contradiction as \\( \\frac{x}{g(x)} + \\frac{g(x)}{x} \\geqslant 2 \\), e.g., from the AM-GM inequality. Therefore, we must have \\( x \\in \\mathcal{S} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\), i.e., \\( g(x) = x \\).\nSubstituting this relationship into the original equation, we obtain \\( P(x): \\quad xf(x) + f(x)x \\leq 2 \\implies xf(x) \\leq 1 \\implies f(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\) for every \\( x \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\). Applying \\( yf(y) \\leq 1 \\) to the equation \\( xf(y) + yf(x) > 2 \\) (since \\( g(x) = x \\)) yields \\( f(x) > \\frac{2}{y} - \\frac{x}{y^2} \\), and taking the limit \\( y \\to x \\) from either side results in \\( f(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\).\nCombining the results, we have \\( f(x) \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\) and \\( f(x) \\geq \\frac{1}{x} \\), implying \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\) as desired. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\nNote: This solution is written more extensively and with more details than necessary for a competition, especially since I include comments at certain points to encourage understanding of the ideas and explain the solution. In practice, this idea would take up only a few lines.\n"

Also, $p^2 \\equiv 1$ modulo $4$, so $(p^{2n}+1)$ and each following term is even but indivisible by $4$. The highest power of $2$ dividing $p^{p-1}-1$ is therefore $2^{k + l + k-1}$ where $2^l$ is the highest power dividing $p+1$.In comparison, $(p+1)!/p$ has factors $(p+1)$, $(2^k n)$ $(2^{k-1} n)$ etc (up to $2n$), and $(p-1)/2-k$ other even factors, so it's divisible at least by $2^{l+k(k+1)/2+(p-1)/2-k}$.

When reversed, this forms an uphill pathway that terminates at that exactly that pair of adjacent cells.\nThere are $2n(n-1)$ such adjacent pairs (each with at least one unique uphill path). In addition, the cell containing the value 1 will always be a valley which, by itself, forms an additional (singleton) uphill path. Therefore the minimum total number of uphill paths is at least $2n(n-1)+1$.\nThe diagram below shows a general family of constructions of Nordic squares that achieve this lower bound, thus proving the claim:\nIn these constructions, numbers are progressively inserted into the white spaces in ascending order emanating outwards from the \"1\" in the corner in the directions of the red arrows, and the remaining j largest numbers are then inserted into the cells labelled as \"mountains\". In this manner, the pathway of finite descent from each pair of adjacent cells is unique, and all terminate at the \"1\" valley, therefore the above-derived minimum is achieved.\n- [Griphomaniac](/wiki/index.php?title=User:Griphomaniac&action=edit&redlink=1) ([talk](/wiki/index.php?title=User_talk:Griphomaniac&action=edit&redlink=1)) 13:16, 21 July 2022 (EDT)\n"

Then the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$. \nTo prove this claim, note that $p$ is the smallest prime that divides $n$, so it is the smallest divisor not equal to $1$, meaning the first $2$ divisors are $1$ and $p$. Furthermore, the smallest divisor of $n$ that is not equal to a power of $p$ (i.e. not equal to $(1,\\, p,\\, p^2\\dots)$ is equal to $q$. This is because all other divisors either include a prime $z$ different from both $q$ and $p$, which is larger than $q$ (since $q$ and $p$ are the smallest two prime divisors of $n$), or don\u2019t include a different prime $z$. In the first case, since $z>q$, the divisor is larger than $q$. In the second case, all divisors divisible by $q^2$ are also larger than $q$, and otherwise are of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$ or $p^x$ for some nonnegative integer $x$. If the divisor is of the form $p^x$, then it is a power of $p$. If it is of the form $p^x \\cdot q^1$, the smallest of these factors is $p^0 \\cdot q^1 = q$. Therefore, (in the case where $2$ or more primes divide $n$) the ordered tuple of divisors is of the form $(1,\\,  p,\\,  p^2 \\dots,\\,  p^a,\\,  q \\dots,\\,  n)$ for some integer $a\\geq 1$, since after each divisor $p^x$, the next smallest divisor is either $p^{x+1}$ or simply $q$. \nIf $a\\geq 2$, the condition fails. This is because $p^{a-1} \\nmid p^a + q$, since $p^a$ is divisible by $p^{a-1}$, but $q$ is not since it is a prime different from $p$. If $a=1$, then $p^{a-1}=p^0=1$, which does divide $q$. Therefore $a$ must equal $1$ for the condition to be satisfied in this case. However, we know that the ordered list of divisors satisfies $d_i \\cdot d_{k+1-i}=n$, meaning since the first $3$ divisors are $(1, p, q)$, then the last $3$ divisors are $(\\frac{n}{q}, \\frac{n}{p}, n)$, so $(\\frac{n}{q})$ must divide $(\\frac{n}{p} + n)$. But $\\frac{n}{q}$ is divisible by $p$, so $\\frac{n}{p} + n$ must also be divisible by $p$, but since $a=1$ $\\frac{n}{p}$ is and $n$ isn't.\nWhen $n=p^x$, it is easy to verify this works for all primes $p$ and all $x\\geq 2$, since $p^y  \\vert  p^{y+1} + p^{y+2}$, and the divisors are ordered as ${1,\\, p,\\, p^2\u2026\\, p^x}$. \n~SpencerD.\n"

All divisors of $n$ which contain a factor of $p_k$ for $k \\geq 2$ is at least as large as $p_2$. So, the only divisors which are possibly less than $p_2$ are of the form  $p_1^{j}$. Also, by construction $p_1$ is less than $p_2$. Putting it all together, this says that the smallest factors are $(1, p_1, \\dots, p_1^j, p_2)$ for some $j \\geq 1$.\nIf $j \\geq 2$, then $p_1^{j-1} \\nmid p_1^j + p_2$, since the LHS has a factor of $p_1$ and the RHS does not since.\nIf $j = 1$, then the largest three factors are $(\\frac{n}{p_2}, \\frac{n}{p_1}, n)$.

We also need $g(j)$ to not be dependent of $n$, so in the expression $f(n+j)-f(n)$, the $n$ needs to cancel.  This mean that the rate of change for $f(n)$ with respect to $n$ needs to be constant.

We know that $f(1)=0$ so $f(1)=m+b=0$ which means that $b=-m$ and our function becomes $f(n)=mn-m=(n-1)m$. Since $f(n)$ needs to be non-negative integer then $m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ then $f(n)$ is increasing or constant, with $f(1)=0$\nThen, $g(j)=f(n+j)-f(n)=(n+j-1)m-(n-1)m=jm$\nThis gives:\n$\\prod_{j=1}^{k}\\left ( a_{n}+jm \\right )=P(a_{n})=a_{n}^{k}+C_{k-1}a_{n}^{k-1}+...+C_{1}a_{n}+k!m^{k}$\nwith $C_{0}=k!m^{k}$ and coefficients of polynomial $\\geq 0$\nThen, $a_{n}=a_{1}+f(n)$\nWhich provides the solution of all infinite sequences of positive integers as:\n$a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)m$, $\\forall m\\geq 0 \\mid m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and $a_{1} \\geq 1 \\mid a_{1} \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n~ Tomas Diaz. orders@tomasdiaz.com\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.
